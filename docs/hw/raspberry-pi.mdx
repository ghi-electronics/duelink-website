There are multiple ways to take advantage of the DUELink ecosystem with the entire Raspberry Pi product line. From full scale Raspberry Pi boards to small micro-level Pico boards.

## RPI and RPI Zero

For using Raspberry Pi and Raspberry Pi Zero, we recommend the [DuePi](../products/adduepi-b) Hat.

![DuePi](pathname:///img/catalog/adduepi-b-1.webp)

This hat uses [UART Interface](../interface/uart) and includes display, buzzer, terminal block for wiring, and a [Downlink](../interface/downlink) socket to extend your RPI with hundreds of available sensors and actuators.

![DuePi](pathname:///img/duepi-daisylinked.webp)

DuePi works great with Raspberry Pi Zero as well, with optional breakable area.

Everything is accessible through any of the RPI supported [Coding Languages](../language/intro), such as [Python](../language/python). Here is a sample that shows the RPI's IP address on the OLED Display.

```python
# Show IP address on display
import sys
import serial
import time
import socket

from DUELink.DUELinkController import DUELinkController

def get_ip_address():
    try:
        # Get all IP addresses associated with the hostname, filtering out 127.0.0.1
        ips = [ip for ip in socket.gethostbyname_ex(socket.gethostname())[2] if not ip.startswith("127.")]
        if ips:
            return ips[0]  # Returns the first non-loopback IP address found
        else:
            # If no non-loopback IP is found, try connecting to an external server to determine the IP used
            s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
            s.connect(("8.8.8.8", 80)) # Connect to Google's DNS server (doesn't send data, just sets up connection)
            ip = s.getsockname()[0]
            s.close()
            return ip
    except socket.error:
        return None
    

myip = get_ip_address()

# DUELink connection
availablePort = DUELinkController.GetConnectionPort()
duelink = DUELinkController("/dev/ttyAMA0")  # uart port define

# DUELink graphics
# Show IP address on screen
duelink.Graphics.Clear(1)
duelink.Graphics.Text("--DUELink--", 0, 33,5)
duelink.Graphics.Text("My IP:" + myip, 0, 1,20)
duelink.Graphics.Show()

# Beep once a second
while True:
    duelink.Sound.Beep(14,1000,100)
    time.sleep(1)
```

[RPILink](../products/adrpilink-a) is another choice for using RPI or RPI Zero. You can pick either [I2C](../interface/i2c) or [UART](../interface/uart) for tethering and [daisylinking](../engine/daisylink) DUELink modules.

![RPILink](pathname:///img/catalog/adrpilink-a-1.webp)

You can also use other third-party breakouts that adds JST connector, like the [Sparkfun Qwiic Shim for Raspberry Pi](https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-qwiic-shim-for-raspberry-pi.html) or [Sparkfun Qwiic pHat](https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-qwiic-phat-v2-0-for-raspberry-pi.html).

![Sparkfun Qwiic Shim or Qwiic pHat](pathname:///img/qwiic-shim-phat.webp)

:::tip
When using the Qwiic pHat, only use one JST connectors as [Downlink](../interface/downlink). You can still use the other sockets to connect other non-DUELink I2C things!
:::

You are now ready to start utilizing DUELink modules with your RPI or RPI Zero. Just select one of the [coding languages](../language/intro), and also look at samples found under any of the modules you are using.

## Raspberry Pi Pico

Using Raspberry Pi Pico is easily achievable using [DuePico](../products/adduepico-b), which includes display, buzzer, buttons, and more!

![DuePico](pathname:///img/catalog/adduepico-b-1.webp)

And of course it includes a [Downlink](../interface/downlink) socket to help you [daisylink](../engine/daisylink) modules.

![DuePico Daisylinked](pathname:///img/duepico-daisylinked.webp)

Visit the [MicroPython](../language/micropython) page to see how Raspberry Pi Pico can be used with DUELink.

## RP2350 & RP2040

Beyond the official RPI Pico, using any board with a RPI microcontroller is possible. We recommend ones with a JST connector, like [Adafruit QT Py RP2040](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4900) or [Sparkfun Pro Micro RP2350](https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-pro-micro-rp2350.html). However, you can use the [Breakout](../products/adbreakout-a) module to wire any boards without JST connector, including RPI Pico!

![RP2040-RP2350-Breakout](pathname:///img/rp2040-rp2350-breakout.webp)

See the [MicroPython](../language/micropython) for one of the most popular options for coding these boards.

:::tip
Pay attention to how much power these little circuits can provide. Consider adding a [Power Inject](../products/adpwrinj-a) module to add more juice!
