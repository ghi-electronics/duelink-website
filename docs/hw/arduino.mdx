This is an interesting option because it allows DUELink to be used in 2 very different ways. You can tether an Arduino-running board to control one DUELink Module or a chain of [Daisylinked](../engine/daisylink) DUELink modules. 

![Arduino UNO 4 Daisylinked](pathname:///img/arduino-uno-r4-daisylinked.webp)

The other option is to program any DUELink module using the Arduino IDE/software to run [Standalone](../language/standalone). For example, use Arduino IDE/software to control [Ghizzy](../products/spghizzy-d).

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}>
![Ghizzy Eyes](pathname:///img/ghizzy-eyes.gif)
</div>

You can also combine both options and tether a standalone arduino-running DUELink Module to other DUELink modules! Basically, you are combining both options above! In this example, we have a DueDuino loaded with Arduino software that is tethered to a dasylink of DUELink modules.

Modules' product pages includes Arduino samples for both Tethered and Standalone options.

## Tethered

Any board running Arduino software can be tethered to DUELink modules using a commonly-used JST connector. An example can be [Arduino Uno R4 WiFi](https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/uno-r4-wifi).

![Arduino UNO  R4 Wifi](pathname:///img/arduino-uno-r4-wifi.webp)

The [Sparkfun Redboard Qwiic](https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-redboard-qwiic.html) is another option.

![Sparkfun Redboard Qwiic](pathname:///img/sparkfun-redboard-qwiic.webp)

Arduino-shaped boards, such as Arduino UNO, that do not have a JST connector can utilize [DueShield](../products/addueshield-a). It has a Downlink connector plus an area with holes matrix for mounting DUELink modules.

![DueShield](pathname:///img/catalog/addueshield-a-1.webp)

You can also use the [Breakout](../products/adbreakout-a) module to wire the connections using either I2C or UART.

![Arduino Breakout UART](pathname:///img/arduino-breakout-uart.webp)

When using I2C, pull-up resistors are required. If your board doesn't have them, we have a [PullUp](../products/adpullup-a) module for you. 

![Arduino Breakout I2C](pathname:///img/arduino-breakout-i2c.webp)

To command and control tether DUELink modules, you need to install the DUELink Arduino library.

Under `Tools` on the top menu of the Arduino IDE select `Manage Libraries`.

![Navigate to Manage Libraries](pathname:///img/arduino-ide-add-library.webp)

Type `DUELink` in the search window and then click `Install`

![Install DUELink Library](pathname:///img/arduino-ide-install-duelink.webp)


Now let's connect any 2 DUELink modules to the [Downlink](../interface/downlink) port. This example code will blink both STAT LEDs on both modules. Note how the STAT LED of the first module blinks only 10 times while the second module blinks forever.

```cpp
#include <DUELink.h>

SerialTransport transport(Serial2);
DUELink duelink(transport);

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial2.begin(115200);
  duelink.Connect();
  duelink.Engine.Select(1);//Selects the first DUELink Module
  duelink.System.StatLed(200, 200, 10);//Blink STAT 1st module 10x
  duelink.Engine.Select(2);//Selects the second DUELink Module
  duelink.System.StatLed(200, 200, 0);//Blinks STAT 2nd Module forever
}

void loop(){
}
```

Here is another example that uses Arduino UNO 4 WIFI with an OLED 0.96 Display, a Button, and a Buzzer modules. Pressing the button generates sound on the buzzer, with the display showing some info.

![Arduino UNO 4 Daisylinked](pathname:///img/arduino-uno-r4-daisylinked.webp)

```cpp
#include "DUELink.h"

// This example runs on Arduino UNO 4 WIFI
// Device 1 is Display OLDE 0.96 
// Device 2 is button
// device 3 is buzzer

TwoWireTransport transport(Wire1);
DUELink duelink(transport);

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Wire1.begin();
  duelink.Connect();
  duelink.Engine.Select(1);
  duelink.Graphics.Clear(1);
  duelink.Graphics.Text("--DUELink--", 0, 10, 1);
  duelink.Graphics.Text("Press button on", 0, 1, 21);
  duelink.Graphics.Text("device 2 to play", 0, 1, 31);
  duelink.Graphics.Text("sound on device 3", 0, 1, 41);
  duelink.Graphics.Show();
  duelink.Engine.Select(2);  
  duelink.Button.Enable(1, 1, 1); 
}

void loop() {
  delay(100);
  duelink.Engine.Select(2);   
  if (duelink.Button.Up(1) == 1) {
    duelink.Engine.Select(3);  
    duelink.Frequency.Write(7, 1000, 50, 0.5);  
  } 
}
```

Simple commands can do complex tasks, such as graphics in this case. This is possible because tethered DUELink modules are preloaded with the standard DUELink [engine](../engine/intro) and are also loaded with appropriate [drivers](../engine/drivers).

## Standalone

Any DUELink module can be run Standalone using the Arduino software, replacing the default DUELink firmware. An example can be [DueDuino](../products/mcdueduino-a).

![DueDuino](pathname:///img/dueduino.webp)

Or a [Ghizzy](../products/spghizzy-d)!

![Ghizzy](pathname:///img/catalog/spghizzy-d-1.webp)

If the module you want to use does not have a USB connector, then you need [USB Hook](../products/adusbhook-a) or a similar module.

![USB hook with RGB3](pathname:///img/usbhook-rgb3.webp)



The micro used on all DUELink modules is STM32C071, which is fully supported by the Arduino IDE, through the ST extension. But wait, we did not just leave it at that! We have a board support package for you.

:::tip
Arduino standalone samples for DUELink modules are provided in their individual product pages. Those make for a great starting point.
:::

Start the Arduino IDE. Under `File`, navigate to `Preferences` then click `Additional boards manager URLs:` icon. In the new window, copy and add both URLs below then click `Ok`. 

```cpp
https://github.com/ghi-electronics/duelink-libraries/raw/main/arduino/BoardManager/package_duelink_index.json
https://github.com/stm32duino/BoardManagerFiles/raw/main/package_stmicroelectronics_index.json  
```

![Add DUELink package links](pathname:///img/arduino-ide-packages.webp)

After the URLs have been added we can now add the "board". Select the `Board Manager` Icon from the side menu and search for `duelink` then click `Install`.

![Add DUELink Board](pathname:///img/arduino-ide-boardmanager.webp)

Finally we need to select the newly install board. Under `Tools` select `Board:`, then select `DUELink`.

![Select DUELink Board](pathname:///img/arduino-ide-selectboard.webp)

Add this code to blink the status LED, which is connected to pin PB8.

```cpp
void setup() {
  // initialize digital pin as an output.
  pinMode(PB8, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(PB8, HIGH);  // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);                      // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(PB8, LOW);   // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);                      // wait for a second
}
```

Use the Arduino `Verify` button to make sure the IDE is able to compile your program.

![Arduino verify button](pathname:///img/arduino-verify-btn.png)

If all went well, you will see something like this:

```
Sketch uses 44608 bytes (34%) of program storage space. Maximum is 131072 bytes.
Global variables use 1820 bytes (7%) of dynamic memory, leaving 22756 bytes for local variables. Maximum is 24576 bytes.
```

USB DFU (Device Firmware Update) is used to load the compiled program.

![Arduino DFU menu](pathname:///img/arduino-menu-dfu.png)


To load the Arduino program onto the DUELink module, put the board in loader mode (DFU) mode. This is done by holding LDR or "A" button down while resetting the board.

![LDR or A Button](pathname:///img/ldr-a-buttons.webp)

Modules that do not have buttons will include a 2-hole-pad (BOOT0 - 3.3V). Use a paper clip (or a wire) to short the two pads. Reset the board by cycling power then remove the paper clip.

![BootMode](pathname:///img/boot-mode.webp)

You can verify the board is in DFU mode by checking the device manager.

![DFU device manager](pathname:///img/device-manager-dfu.webp)

In order for the Arduino IDE to be able to DFU load programs onto the module, it relies on a tool from ST Micro. Go ahead and install [STM32CubeProgrammer](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html) from ST Micro.


Once STM32CubeProgrammer is installed, click on the `Upload` arrow, this will compile the sketch file and upload it to the device. 

![Compile and Upload](pathname:///img/arduino-ide-upload.webp)

:::info
If you'd like to go back to using DUELink software you'll need to reload the DUELink firmware using the [Console](../console). Details are also found on the [Loader](../loader) page.

## Theory of Operation

Loading Arduino software onto any DUELink module, turns it into an Arduino board. You will need to rely on the provided board schematics and the standard Arduino libraries for using the module itself. When a chain of modules are used, the first one will be running Arduino software standalone, we will call it a "Host". All other modules are tethered and will must continue to run the standard DUElink firmware. These tethered modules have the usual DUELink addressing, but the host (DueDuino in this example) does not have an address.

![DueDuino Host](pathname:///img/arduino-dueduino-host.webp)

In comparison, when Arduino is not used, and the host is a PC for example, DueDuino has an address like any other module, because it is not the host. You can now use a coding language, like [Python](../language/python), on the PC to control IOs on DueDuino and the other modules. 

![DueDuino PC Host](pathname:///img/dueduino-pchost-daisylink.webp)

:::tip
Any module can run Arduino to run standalone. We are using DueDuino here for demonstration purposes.
