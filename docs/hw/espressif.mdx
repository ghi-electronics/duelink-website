Espressif offers several low-cost wireless chipsets and modules, including ESP32. Most products support both WiFi and Bluetooth. There are several ways to program these modules, including [Arduino](./arduino) and [MicroPython](../language/micropython). Both of these options are supported by DUELink.

This is one the many supported [coding languages](../language/intro) by DUELink. Just like it works on other devices, like [Raspberry Pi Pico](./raspberry-pi), it also works on Espressif devices, such as ESP32.
