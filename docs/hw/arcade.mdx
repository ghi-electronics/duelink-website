Examples:
* Use accelerometer to move game objects.
* Change the game's environment to day and night based on a light sensor. 
* Touching "lava" will change the color of an external light. 
* Losing in a game can trigger an external alarm.

Not only games, BrainPad Arcade can be used as a portal to the physical world.

Examples:

* Thermostat temperature control.
* Gauge cluster.
* Graphical plot of physical measurements.

The [MakeCode](../language/makecode) page shows how to use the software. More info on BrainPad Arcade is found at https://www.brainpad.com/.
