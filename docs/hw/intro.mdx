![Supported Hardware](pathname:///img/duelink-supported-hardware.png)

DUELink modules work with several types of hardware devices, from [Raspberry Pi](./raspberry-pi), [Arduino](./arduino) & [BeagleBoard](./beagleboard) to [Phones and Tablets](phone-tablet), or [PC's & Laptops](./pc-laptop.mdx). These hardware devices work with one or more of the supported [Coding Languages](../language/intro).

Modules connect to these hardware devices over several [Interface](../interface/intro) options. Some of these third-party devices include a compatible connector and can connect directly to any of the DUELink modules, using the [I2C Interfaces](../interface/i2c).

If using a board without a compatible JST connector, an adaptor can be used. Here are some examples from Sparkfun.

The DUELink Breakout modules can also be used with almost any hardware!

Finally, you do not need to use any of these devices as DUELink modules can also run [Standalone](../language/standalone).
