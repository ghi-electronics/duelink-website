# Supported Hardware

![Supported Hardware](pathname:///img/duelink-supported-hardware.webp)

DUELink modules work with several types of hardware devices, including [computers](./pc-laptop.mdx), [phones](phone-tablet), [Raspberry Pi](./raspberry-pi), [Arduino](./arduino), [micro:bit](./microbit), and [BeagleBoard](./beagleboard). These devices work with one or more of the supported [Coding Languages](../language/intro).

Modules connect to these hardware devices over several [Interface](../interface/intro) options. Some of these third-party devices include a compatible connector and can connect directly to any of the DUELink modules, using the [I2C Interfaces](../interface/i2c).

We also offer many adapters for popular boards, such as [DuePI](../products/adduepi-b) and [RPILink](../products/adrpilink-a) for [Raspberry Pi](./raspberry-pi).

Other examples include [RaveBit](../products/adravebit-a) and [LinkBit](../products/adlinkbit-a), made for [micro:bit](./microbit).

Finally, you do not need to use any third-party device as DUELink modules can also run [standalone](../language/standalone).
