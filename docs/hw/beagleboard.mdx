BeagleBoard has many open-source offerings and they all work with the DUELink ecosystem.

![BeagleBoard Family of Products](pathname:///img/beagleboard-family.png)

Any of the [Coding Language](../language/intro) options can be use on these boards. Depending on the boards, there might be an easier way to connect DUELink modules.

## BeaglePlay

This board has a built in JST connector with [I2C](../interface/i2c) signals, I2C5 to be exact! Their [Qwicc Example](https://docs.beagleboard.org/boards/beagleplay/demos-and-tutorials/using-qwiic.html#beagleplay-qwiic) is a good starting point on how to access the I2C bus. Consider this as a DUELink [Downlink](../interface/downlink) socket.

## BeagleY-AI

This board has a [Raspberry PI](raspberry-pi) compatible footprint/pinout. We recommend using DUELink [DuePI](../catalog/adaptor/duepi), which adds a display, a buzzer, a terminal block, and [Downlink](../interface/downlink) socket.

The hat uses UART for communication. Here is an example to show the system's IP address on the display.


```python
import sys
import serial
import time
import socket

from DUELink.DUELinkController import DUELinkController

def get_ip_address():
    try:
        # Get all IP addresses associated with the hostname, filtering out 127.0.0.1
        ips = [ip for ip in socket.gethostbyname_ex(socket.gethostname())[2] if not ip.startswith("127.")]
        if ips:
            return ips[0]  # Returns the first non-loopback IP address found
        else:
            # If no non-loopback IP is found, try connecting to an external server to determine the IP used
            s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
            s.connect(("8.8.8.8", 80)) # Connect to Google's DNS server (doesn't send data, just sets up connection)
            ip = s.getsockname()[0]
            s.close()
            return ip
    except socket.error:
        return None
    

myip = get_ip_address()

# DUELink connection
availablePort = DUELinkController.GetConnectionPort()
duelink = DUELinkController("/dev/ttyAMA0")  # uart port define

# DUELink graphics
# Show IP address on screen
duelink.Graphics.Clear(1)
duelink.Graphics.Text("--DUELink--", 0, 33,5)
duelink.Graphics.Text("My IP:" + myip, 0, 1,20)
duelink.Graphics.Show()

# Beep once a second
while True:
    duelink.Sound.Beep(14,1000,100)
    time.sleep(1)
```

# Other Beagles

Use the [Breakout](../catalog/adaptor/breakout) module to wire [UART Interface](../interface/uart) or [I2C Interface](../interface/i2c)from any BeagleBoard. When using I2C, pull-up resistors are required. The DUELink [PullUp](../catalog/adaptor/pullup) module is available if needed.
