DUELink module versatility allows it to work with Phones and Tablets. The modules' internal [Scripting](../engine/scripting) engine is accessible from many [Interfaces](../interface/intro), and in this case, a serial [UART](../interface/uart) connection is all it takes.

When connecting to an Android system, any DUElink module will present itself as a virtual serial connection. You can quickly try it by installing any serial terminal program to send commands.

Similarly, a [Python](../language/python), [JavaScript](../language/javascript) or [C++](../language/cpp) can be used, as long as you have access to the virtual serial port.
