micro:bit is an educational board with on-board LEDs and sensors, plus it has edge pads allowing it to plug into accessories.

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}>
![micro:bit](pathname:///img/microbit.webp)
</div>

To connect micro:bit to one of the many DUElink modules, you can use the [LinkBit](../products/adlinkbit-a) module. It extends the micro:bit edge connector and adds a [Downlink](../interface/downlink) connector.

</div>

Go beyond and use [RaveBit](../products/adravebit-a) empower your micro:bit with a 1.8" graphical display. Use Microsoft [MakeCode](../language/makecode) to control the display directly and then add any DUELink modules you need to the included Downlink connector.

Alternatively, you can also use any of the boards that include an on-board JST connector like the [Sparkfun Qwiic micro:bit Breakout](https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-qwiic-micro-bit-breakout.html)

This board includes two JST sockets. One of them becomes a [Downlink](../interface/downlink) bringing you hundreds of DUELink module options that connect in a [Daisylink](../engine/daisylink).

Most of these third-party boards don't have the required pull-up resistors on the I2C bus. This might not be a problem in most cases, but we have a [PullUp](../products/adpullup-a) module to solve this if there's an issue. When using our [LinkBit](../products/adlinkbit-a) adapter, a PullUp module isn't needed.

## MakeCode

[Microsoft MakeCode](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/makecode) is the most used interface with micro:bit. It is block-based, making it an easy choice for beginners and young learners.

![micro:bit MakeCode](pathname:///img/microbit-makecode.webp)
</div>

The [MakeCode](../language/makecode) page has everything you need.

## MicroBlocks

MicroBlocks is a great option to program micro:bit using blocks.

</div>

:::tip
DUELink provides a stronger support using MicroBlocks over MakeCode.

Did you know that MicroBlocks can run directly on DUELink modules? See "Alternatives" below!

The [MicroBlocks](../language/microblocks) language page has all necessary details!

## Alternatives

One of the common uses of micro:bit is through utilizing alligator clips to wire motors and sensors.

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}>
![micro:bit with alligator clips](pathname:///img/microbit-clip.webp)
</div>

If you enjoy the edge connector and alligator clips, DUELink offers bit-compatible boards, such as the ultra-low-cost [CincoBit](../products/mccincobit-e) and also [PixoBit](../products/mcpixobit-d) that includes a display.

:::tip
The DUELink [CincoBit](../products/mccincobit-e.mdx) and [PixoBit](../products/mcpixobit-d) work like all other DUELink modules, through DUELink [Scripting Engine](../engine/scripting) or the [Arduino](arduino) IDE.

</div>

These microcomputers can be used with micro:bit accessories, like in this robot!

</div>

With [MicroBlocks](../language/microblocks) support, users can do everything in block-coding, from connecting micro:bit accessories, to [DaisyLinking](../engine/daisylink) modules.

:::tip
Typically, miro:bit accessories ship with "MakeCode Extensions" that are provided by the the accessories' manufactures. These extensions do not work in MicroBlocks. The user needs to have some basic electronics experience to know how to use these accessories.
