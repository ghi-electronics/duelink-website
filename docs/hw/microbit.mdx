# micro:bit

micro:bit is an educational board with on-board LEDs and sensors, plus it has edge pads allowing it to plug into accessories.

![micro:bit](pathname:///img/microbit.png)

To connect micro:bit to one of the many DUElink modules, you can use the [LinkBit](../products/adlinkbit-a) module. It extends the micro:bit edge connector and adds a [Downlink](../interface/downlink) connector.

Alternately you can also use any of the boards that include an on-board JST connector like the [Sparkfun Qwiic micro:bit Breakout](https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-qwiic-micro-bit-breakout.html)

This board includes two JST sockets. One of them becomes a [Downlink](../interface/downlink) bringing you hundreds of DUELink module options, that connect in a [Daisylink](../engine/daisylink).

Most of these third-party boards don't have the required pull-up resistors on the I2C bus. This might not be a problem in most cases, but we have a [PullUp](../products/adpullup-a) module to solve this if there's an issue. When using our [LinkBit](../products/adlinkbit-a) adapter a PullUp module isn't needed.

## MakeCode

[Microsoft MakeCode](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/makecode) is the most used interface with micro:bit. It is block-based, making it an easy choice for beginners and young learners.

The [MakeCode](../language/makecode) page has everything you need.

## MicroBlocks

[MicroBlocks](https://microblocks.fun/) is a great option to program micro:bit using blocks.

![MicroBlocks IDE](pathname:///img/microblocks-ide.png)

We recommend this over MakeCode as at has a first-class support for DUELink. Not only that, MicroBlocks can run directly on DUELink modules! See "Alternatives" below.

The [MicroBlocks](../language/microblocks) language page has all necessary details!

## Alternatives

One of common uses of micro:bit is by utilizing alligator clips.

If you enjoy the edge connector and alligator clips, DUELink offers bit-compatible boards, such as the ultra-low-cost [CincoBit](../products/mccincobit-e) and also [PixoBit](../products/mcpixobit-d) that includes a display.

These microcomputers can be used with micro:bit accessories, like in this robot!

The DUELink [CincoBit](../products/mccincobit-e.mdx) and [PixoBit](../products/mcpixobit-d) work like all other DUELink modules, through DUELink [Scripting Engine](../engine/scripting) or the [Arduino](arduino) IDE.

With [MicroBlocks](../language/microblocks) support, users can do everything in block-coding, from connecting micro:bit accessories, to [DaisyLinking](../engine/daisylink) modules.
