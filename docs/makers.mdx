## Works With Your Hardware!

DUELink modules work in so many ways, allowing you to continue using your existing hardware and software. 

Perhaps you want to use [Raspberry Pi](./hw/raspberry-pi) with [Python](./language/python).

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}>
![RPI Daisylink](pathname:///img/duepi-daisylinked.webp)
</div>

Or use [Arduino](./hw/arduino) with its software or with [MicroPython](./language/micropython).

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}>

</div>

You can even utilize DUELink modules using [PCs and Laptops](./hw/pc-laptop.mdx) with [JavaScript](./language/javascript), [Python](./language/python), [.NET](./language/dotnet), and beyond!

Connect one, or connect them all, DUELink  [Product Catalog](./catalog/products) has an impressive list of options, thanks to its modern [Daisylink](./engine/daisylink).

Not sure which modules to use? Start with the [Essential Modules](./products/ktessen-a) Kit.

Each module has a built in libraries for you! Simple ASCII human-readable commands can show graphics on the display and record files on a USB memory stick! See the [Standard Library](./engine/stdlib) for an impressive list of options.

## Beginners &rarr; Experts

Beginners can tinker with the built in [scripting](./engine/scripting) language, or use [MicroBlocks](./language/microblocks) for an easy block-coding option. Use one of the Microcomputers, such as [Stamp](./products/mcstamp-b) or [DueDuino](./products/mcdueduino-a).

Seasoned developers can go beyond the built in [engine](./engine/intro) and [scripting language](./engine/scripting) to code the on-board STM32 Cortex-M0 micro directly with their specific software, for example [C++](./language/cpp) and [Arduino](./hw/arduino).

## Make Your Own!

Do you want to make [your own modules](./catalog/third-party)? We have made the [Stick](./products/mcstick-a) just for you!

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}>

## Enclosing Projects

The standard unified sizing makes it easy to mount modules on one of the [Holey Boards](./products/axholey).

This standard also allows for easier 3D-printed and laser-cut enclosures. See [Specs](./specs) for hole-alignment details.

## Engineers are Makers at Heart!

While we have created and globally shipped commercial products over the years, maybe millions, we have not lost our passion and love for what we do. Here are images from our contributions to the first NYC Maker Fair and the first Detroit Maker Fair!

We continue to share our passion and work in the electronics hardware and software engineering to manufacturing.
