Whether you are a beginner or a seasoned expert, DUELink has something to help you build your dream project. Here is a roulette game we had fun building!

Beginners can start with one of the Microcomputers, such as [Stamp](./products/mcstamp-a) or [DueDuino](./products/mcdueduino-a).

Seasoned developers can use the system's built in [engine](./engine/interrupt) and [scripting language](./engine/scripting), or code the on-board micro directly with their specific needs, for example [C++](./language/cpp) and [Arduino](./hw/arduino). 

You can even [make your own modules](./catalog/third-party)! We have a [Stick](./products/mcstick-a) just for you!

The standard unified sizing makes it much easier to design 3D-printed and laser-cut enclosures. See [Specs](./specs) for more details.
