# Makers


Whether you are a beginner or a seasoned expert, DUELink has something to help you build your dream project. Here is a roulette game we had fun building!

This is an AI powered I-never-lose tic-tac-toe game!

Beginners can start with one of the Microcomputers, such as [Stamp](./products/mcstamp-b) or [DueDuino](./products/mcdueduino-a).

Seasoned developers can use the system's built in [engine](./engine/interrupt) and [scripting language](./engine/scripting), or code the on-board micro directly with their specific needs, for example [C++](./language/cpp) and [Arduino](./hw/arduino). 

You can even [make your own modules](./catalog/third-party)! We have a [Stick](./products/mcstick-a) just for you!

The standard unified sizing makes it easy to mount modules on one of the [Holey Boards](./products/axholey).

This standard also allows for easier 3D-printed and laser-cut enclosures. See [Specs](./specs) for hole-alignment details.

Engineers are makers at heart! While ee have created and shipped amazing commercial products over the years, maybe Millions, we have not lost our passion and love for what we do. Here are images from the first NYC Maker Fair and the first Detroit Maker Fair!
