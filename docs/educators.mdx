# Educators

STEM Educators can turn abstract coding concepts into tangible, interactive experiences. Students write code and instantly see it come alive—blinking LEDs, moving motors, sensing the environment. No soldering, no setup delays—just plug, code, and create.

Start with one of the education-focused Microcomputers:


<div style={{display: 'block',  justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center', textAlign: 'center'}}>

<table>
<td width='25%'>
    <img alt="Back" src="/img/catalog/mcduestem-b-1.png" />
    
    <Button
        style={{ margin: "10px", color: "white" }}
        label="DueSTEM"
        link="./products/mcduestem-b"
    />
</td>
<td width='25%'>
    <img alt="Size" src="/img/catalog/mcclipit-b-1.png" />
    
    <Button
        style={{ margin: "10px", color: "white" }}
        label="ClipIt"
        link="./products/mcclipit-b"
    />
</td>
<td width='25%'>
    <img alt="Size" src="/img/catalog/mccincobit-e-1.png" />
    
    <Button
        style={{ margin: "10px", color: "white" }}
        label="CincoBit"
        link="./products/mccincobit-e"
    />
</td>
<td width='25%'>
    <img alt="Size" src="/img/catalog/mcpixobit-d-1.png" />
    <Button
        style={{ margin: "10px", color: "white" }}
        label="PixoBit"
        link="./products/mcpixobit-d"
    />
</td>
</table>
</div>

The Specialty product category also includes many unique and exciting options, such as the festive holiday tree and the tiny Ghizzy robot!

<div style={{display: 'block',  justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center', textAlign: 'center'}}>

<table>
<td width='50%'>
    <img alt="Back" src="/img/catalog/sptree-b-3.png" />
    
    <Button
        style={{ margin: "10px", color: "white" }}
        label="Holiday Tree"
        link="./products/sptree-b"
    />
</td>
<td width='50%'>
    <img alt="Size" src="/img/catalog/spghizzy-b-3.png" />
    
    <Button
        style={{ margin: "10px", color: "white" }}
        label="Ghizzy"
        link="./products/spghizzy-b"
    />
</td>
</table>
</div>

Once students are ready, they can start utilizing all kinds of sensors and actuators through a [Daisylink](./engine/daisylink).

![Daisylink](pathname:///img/daisylink.png)

Connecting DUELink modules to [Arduino](./hw/arduino), [micro:Bit](./hw/microbit), [Raspberry Pi](./hw/raspberry-pi) is also fully supported. You can even connect and use DUELink modules directly with a [PC](./hw/pc-laptop) or a [Phone](./hw/phone-tablet)! 

![Arduino UNO 4 Daisylinked](pathname:///img/arduino-uno-r4-daisylinked.png)


You are basically using your favorite [supported hardware](./hw/intro) with the desired [coding language](./language/intro).

## MicroBlocks

For coding, start with [MicroBlocks](./language/microblocks) for a fantastic **block-coding** experience! Users drag-and-drop on the PC to instantly see changes on the connected hardware. There is no need to "download" to the device.

![MicroBlocks](pathname:///img/microblocks.png)

Users can run MicroBlocks on the web or they can download local offline software. This gets better as MicroBlocks VM has been ported to DUELink modules, allowing any module to host MicroBlocks.

![MicroBlocks IDE](pathname:///img/microblocks-connect-1.png)

Visit the [MicroBlocks](./language/microblocks) page and get started in minutes!

## DUELink Scripts
For **type-coding** users can start DUELink [Console](./console), which includes everything to start loading [scripts](./engine/scripting). It runs in a browser and requires no installations.

![DUELink Console](pathname:///img/due-console.png)

## Coding Languages

Educators can also choose one of the many [coding language](./language/intro) options. For example, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and data science students might select [Python](./language/python).

## Arcade Game Development

![Arcade](pathname:///img/arcade-front.png)

Part of GHI Electronics offering is **BrainPad Arcade** which focuses on game development through Microsoft MakeCode Arcade. DUELink adds **physical computing** to game development in your classroom. The [Arcade](./hw/arcade) page has more info.

## A STEMission! 

<div style={{display: 'block',  justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center', textAlign: 'center'}}>

![STEM Kids](pathname:///img/stem-kids.png)

How many students haven't we exposed to technology yet?", asks DUELink founder - Gus Issa, who believes: Tomorrow's greatest ideas will **stem** from the digital knowledge we plant today.
