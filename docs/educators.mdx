# Educators

STEM Educators can turn abstract coding concepts into tangible, interactive experiences. Students write code and instantly see it come alive—blinking LEDs, moving motors, sensing the environment. No soldering, no setup delays—just plug, code, and create.

Start with one of the education-focused Microcomputers:


<div style={{display: 'block',  justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center', textAlign: 'center'}}>

<table>
<td width='25%'>
    <img alt="Back" src="/img/catalog/mcduestem-b-1.png" />
    
    <Button
        style={{ margin: "10px", color: "white" }}
        label="DueSTEM"
        link="./products/mcduestem-b"
    />
</td>
<td width='25%'>
    <img alt="Size" src="/img/catalog/mcclipit-b-1.png" />
    
    <Button
        style={{ margin: "10px", color: "white" }}
        label="ClipIt"
        link="./products/mcclipit-b"
    />
</td>
<td width='25%'>
    <img alt="Size" src="/img/catalog/mccincobit-e-1.png" />
    
    <Button
        style={{ margin: "10px", color: "white" }}
        label="CincoBit"
        link="./products/mccincobit-e"
    />
</td>
<td width='25%'>
    <img alt="Size" src="/img/catalog/mcpixobit-d-1.png" />
    <Button
        style={{ margin: "10px", color: "white" }}
        label="PixoBit"
        link="./products/mcpixobit-d"
    />
</td>

## MicroBlocks

For coding, start with [MicroBlocks](./language/microblocks) for a fantastic **block-coding** experience! Users drag-and-drop on the PC to see instantly see changes on the connected hardware. There is no need to "download" to the device.

![MicroBlocks](pathname:///img/microblocks.png)

Users can run MicroBlocks on the web or they can download local offline software. This gets better as MicroBlocks VM has been ported to DUELink modules, allowing any module to host MicroBlocks.

![MicroBlocks IDE](pathname:///img/microblocks-ide.png)

Visit teh [MicroBlocks](./language/microblocks) page and get started in minutes!
