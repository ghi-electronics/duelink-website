# Educators

STEM Educators can turn abstract coding concepts into tangible, interactive experiences. Students write code and instantly see it come alive—blinking LEDs, moving motors, sensing the environment. No soldering, no setup delays—just plug, code, and create.

There are thousands of ways DUELink can be used with the standard [DUELink engine](./engine/intro) or with [MicroBlocks](./language/microblocks). However, we have hand selected a few DUELink boards for Educators or anyone who is just starting out with coding circuits.

:::tip
These eductor-focused boards ship preloaded with MicroBlocks. Users can always load and reload any DUELink module with any of the available options.
:::

Each one of these boards has a dedicated page with "Getting Started" instructions and several pre-made samples.

## Other Hardware

DUELink modules work in so many ways, allowing you to continue to use your existing hardware/software. Perhaps you want to use [micro:bit](./hw/microbit) with [Microsoft MakeCode](./language/makecode).


![LinkBit](pathname:///img/microbit-linkbit.png)

Or use [Raspberry Pi](./hw/raspberry-pi) with [Python](./language/python).

![RPI Daisylink](pathname:///img/duepi-daisylinked.png)

Or use [Arduino](./hw/arduino) with its software or with [MicroPython](./language/micropython).

![Arduino UNO 4 Daisylinked](pathname:///img/arduino-uno-r4-daisylinked.png)

You can even utilize DUELink modules using [PCs and Laptops](./hw/pc-laptop.mdx) with [JavaScript](./language/javascript), [Python](./language/python), [.NET](./language/dotnet), and beyond!

![Computer with modules](pathname:///img/usbhook-servo-x1.png)

The ever-growing [Product Catalog](./catalog/intro) has an impressive list of options!

## Daisylink

Connect one, or connect them all, DUELink gives you options, thanks to its modern [Daisylink](./engine/daisylink).

![Daisylink](pathname:///img/daisylink.png)

Not sure which modules to use? Start with the [Essential Modules](./products/ktessen-a) Kit.

## DUELink Scripts

While you can use your favorite hardware and software, as explained earlier. All modules also include a built in [scripting](./engine/scripting) engine. Students can utilize this Python-BASIC-like friendly language for a **type-coding** option. Coding is done on a [Console](./console) that runs in a web browser and requires no installations.
