# Educators

STEM Educators can turn abstract coding concepts into tangible, interactive experiences. Students write code and instantly see it come alive—blinking LEDs, moving motors, sensing the environment. No soldering, no setup delays—just plug, code, and create.

## Hand-picked Options

While technically all DUELink boards can be used in education. However, we have hand selected these DUELink boards for STEM educators.

:::tip
These educator-focused boards ship preloaded with MicroBlocks. Users can always load, and reload, any DUELink module with any of the available software options.

## Ultra Low-Cost

These low-cost boards offer an edge-connector similar to [micro:bit](./hw/microbit). Everything on-board is fully supported by the [DUELink engine](./engine/intro) and [MicroBlocks](./language/microblocks). Also, with a little experience, users can utilize the edge connector and build extensions to control micro:bit robots and other accessories!

:::tip
These boards can be codded using [DUELink engine](./engine/intro) or using [MicroBlocks](./language/microblocks), and not using MakeCode.

Using [MakeCode](./language/makecode) is possible when tethering [micro:bit](./hw/microbit) to DUELink modules.

## $100 STEM Classroom!

STEMify an entire classroom with everything you need for under $100! Students can double-up and use this pack of 14x CincoBit boards. Worry not, storage boxes and USB cables are also included.

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}>
![CincoBit Kit](pathname:///img/catalog/ktcincobit-e-1.webp)
</div>

Students will start controlling the LED matrix and making sounds in minutes, then use logic to build games in hours. Everything will be done in the student-friendly [MicroBlocks](./language/microblocks) drag-and-drop block coding environment.

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}>
![MicroBlocks](pathname:///img/microblocks-sample.webp)
</div>

Optionally, students can use the edge connector to learn about digital/analog inputs/outputs, and can control motion using servo motors.

![Cincobit Servos](pathname:///img/cincobit-servos.webp)

Have a micro:bit accessory in mind, such as a robot? A pre-created extension can be used by the students to make a "Dancing robot"! 

![Cincobit Robot Dance](pathname:///img/cincobit-robot-dance.webp)

The journey does not end there as the [Downlink](./interface/downlink) connector can be used to [Daisylink](./engine/daisylink) other DUELink modules, as explained later on this page.

## Duino

We have designed DueDuino for all [Arduino](./hw/arduino) fans, with matching headers to help you experiment with "Shields".

You can code DueDuino using the [DUELink engine](./engine/intro), or fully code it using the [Arduino](./hw/arduino) IDE, turning it into a low-cost Arduino-compatible board with [Downlink](./interface/downlink) connector.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
![DueDuino](pathname:///img/catalog/mcdueduino-a-3.webp)

<Button
        style={{ margin: "10px", color: "white" , textAlign: 'center'}}

## MicroBlocks

Use [MicroBlocks](./language/microblocks) for a fantastic **block-coding** experience! Users drag-and-drop on the PC to instantly see changes on the connected hardware. There is no need to "download" to the device.

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}>
![MicroBlocks](pathname:///img/microblocks.webp)
</div>

Users can run MicroBlocks on the web or they can download local offline software.

## Third-Party Options

DUELink modules work in so many ways, allowing you to continue using your existing hardware and software. 

Perhaps you want to use [micro:bit](./hw/microbit) with [Microsoft MakeCode](./language/makecode) tethered to an LED module.


<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}>
![LinkBit](pathname:///img/microbit-linkbit.webp)
</div>

Or use [Raspberry Pi](./hw/raspberry-pi) with [Python](./language/python) tethered to a barometer.

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}>
![RPI Daisylink](pathname:///img/duepi-daisylinked.webp)
</div>

Or use [Arduino](./hw/arduino) with its software or with [MicroPython](./language/micropython) tethered to a [Daisylink](./engine/daisylink) of modules.

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}>
![Arduino UNO 4 Daisylinked](pathname:///img/arduino-uno-r4-daisylinked.webp)
</div>

You can even tether DUELink modules to [PCs and Laptops](./hw/pc-laptop.mdx), then control them using [JavaScript](./language/javascript), [Python](./language/python), [.NET](./language/dotnet), and beyond!

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}>
![Computer with modules](pathname:///img/usbhook-servo-x1.webp)

## DUELink Scripts

While you can use your favorite hardware and software to control DUELink modules, all modules also include a built in [scripting](./engine/scripting) engine. Students can utilize this Python-BASIC-like friendly language for a **type-coding** option. Coding is done on a [Console](./console) that runs in a web browser and requires no installations.
