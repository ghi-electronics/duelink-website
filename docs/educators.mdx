# Educators

---

STEM Educators can turn abstract coding concepts into tangible, interactive experiences. Students write code and instantly see it come alive—blinking LEDs, moving motors, sensing the environment. No soldering, no setup delays—just plug, code, and create.

## Hardware 

You can start with any of the available Microcomputers, such as [DueSTEM](./catalog/microcomputer/duestem) and [Clipit](./catalog/microcomputer/clipit).

For boards with "edge connector", check out [CincoBit](./catalog/microcomputer/cincobit) or its OLED display sister, [PixoBit](./catalog/microcomputer/pixobit).

If [Arduino](./hw/arduino) is something you are familiar with with then we recommend [DueDuino](./catalog/microcomputer/dueduino).

## Software

On the software front, the [Console](./console) includes everything an educator needs to help students start typing code. It runs in a browser and requires no installations.

If block coding is desired, [MicroBlocks](./language/microblocks) is a fantastic choice for multiple reasons! Users can run MicroBlocks on the web or they can download local offline software. Also, MicroBlocks VM has been ported to DUELink modules, allowing any module to host MicroBlocks.

Artificial Intelligence (AI), and data science students love [Python](./language/python), which is one of the many supported [languages](./language/intro).
