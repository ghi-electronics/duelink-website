# Interfaces


Every single DUELink module works with [USB](./usb), [I2C](./i2c), and [UART](./uart) on their Uplink connector. This socket is marked with `U` and is off-white color.

Some modules are made in a microcomputer form-factor and, therefore, the Uplink connector is replaced with a USB connector.

[Supported Hardware](../hw/intro) devcies can use the above interfaces with one of the [Coding Languages](../language/intro).

The [Downlink](./downlink) socket is marked with `D` and it is blue color. It is automatically handled by the system and allows for [Daisylinking](../engine/daisylink) modules.

DUELink doesn't stop there as it also provides ways for connecting modules over a [wireless](./wireless) connection.
