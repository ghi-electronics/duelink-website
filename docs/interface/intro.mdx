# Interfaces

DUELink modules are designed to be versatile and dynamic, with multiple interface options.

---

## Uplink

Every single DUELink module works with [USB](./usb), [I2C](./i2c), and [UART](./uart) on their Uplink connector. This common JST connector is marked with `U` and is off-white color.

The first use of Uplink connector is to connect DUELink modules to a [Supported Hardware](../hw/intro).

Another option is to use Uplink to [Daisylink](../engine/daisylink) DUELink modules.

Note that some modules are made in a microcomputer-form-factor and the Uplink connector is replaced with a USB connector, which can only use the [USB](./usb) interface.

## Downlink

The Downlink socket is marked with `D` and it is blue color. It is automatically handled by the [internal engine](../engine/intro) and allows for [Daisylinking](../engine/daisylink) modules.

## Wireless

DUELink doesn't stop there as it also provides ways for connecting modules over a [wireless](./wireless) connection.
