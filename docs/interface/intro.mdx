# Interfaces

DUELink modules are designed to be versatile and dynamic, with multiple interface options.

---

## Uplink

Every single DUELink module works with [USB](./usb), [I2C](./i2c), and [UART](./uart) on their Uplink connector. This socket is marked with `U` and is off-white color.

Some modules are made in a microcomputer form-factor and, therefore, the Uplink connector is replaced with a USB connector.

[Supported Hardware](../hw/intro) devices can use the above interfaces with one of the [Coding Languages](../language/intro).

## Downlink

The [Downlink](./downlink) socket is marked with `D` and it is blue color. It is automatically handled by the system and allows for [Daisylinking](../engine/daisylink) modules.

## Wireless

DUELink doesn't stop there as it also provides ways for connecting modules over a [wireless](./wireless) connection.

## Connector Orientation

Both `U` and `D` JST connectors are keyed to prevent from wrong orientation use. Do not try to force in the connector with the wrong orientation!

Doing so will may cause the internal pins to be bent. If happened, the bent pins can be corrected using a tiny screwdriver.
