# Interfaces

DUELink modules are designed to be versatile and dynamic, with multiple interface options.

---

## Uplink

Every single DUELink module works with [USB](./usb), [I2C](./i2c), and [UART](./uart) on their Uplink connector. This common JST connector is marked with `U` and is off-white color.

The first use of Uplink connector is to connect DUELink modules to a [Supported Hardware](../hw/intro).

Another option is to use Uplink to [daisylink](../engine/daisylink) DUELink modules.

Note that some modules are made in a microcomputer-form-factor and the Uplink connector is replaced with a USB connector, which can only use the [USB](./usb) interface.

## Downlink

The Downlink socket is marked with `D` and it is blue color. It is automatically handled by the [internal engine](../engine/intro) and allows for [Daisylinking](../engine/daisylink) modules.

## Wireless

DUELink doesn't stop there as it also provides ways for connecting modules over a [wireless](./wireless) connection.

## Connector Orientation

Both `U` and `D` JST connectors are keyed to prevent from wrong orientation use. Do not try to force in the connector with the wrong orientation!

Doing so will may cause the internal pins to be bent. If happened, the bent pins can be corrected using a tiny screwdriver.
