USB on DUELink module is configured in standard CDC class, making these modules show up as virtual serial port to the connected [Hardware](../hw/intro).

No drivers are necessary on any modern Windows, Linux, Android or Mac operating systems. These systems use a [Host Language](../language/intro) to command a [Daisylink](../engine/daisylink) of modules.
