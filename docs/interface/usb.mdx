# USB


All DUELink modules include USB support. A few boards have a built-in USB connector, but others need an adapter like [USB Hook](../products/adusbhook-a) or [USB Stick](../products/adusbstick-a).

USB on DUELink module is configured in standard CDC class, making these modules show up as virtual serial port to the connected [Hardware](../hw/intro).

No drivers are necessary on any modern Windows, Linux, Android or Mac operating systems. These systems use a [Host Language](../language/intro) to command a [Daisylink](../engine/daisylink) of modules.

USB is also first choice with the [Console](../console) and [Demo Website](https://demo.duelink.com/).

## HID Interface

With the CDC (Virtual Serial) interface, USB also includes HID (Human Interface Device) Class. A USB connected computer/phone (any OS) will see Serial+Keyboard+Mouse devices on the same USB cable (composite device). The Serial interface is used to communicate with the [engine](../engine/intro). This works just like all other interfaces, such as [I2C](./i2c).

The connected OS will receive "keyboard keystrokes" and "mouse movements" using the `Hid(type, [data])` function. `type` is 1: Keyboard - 2: mouse. The `[data]` array depends on the device.


**Mouse** Data | Use
--- | ---
Byte 0 | Buttons (bitmask: Left=1, Right=2, Middle=4)
Byte 1-2 | X movement (signed int16)
Byte 3-4 | Y movement (signed int16)
Byte 5 | Wheel (signed int8)
Byte 6 | Pan (signed int8)
 
 
**Keyboard** Data | Use
--- | ---
Byte 0 | Modifier keys (e.g., Ctrl, Shift)
Byte 1 | Reserved (always 0)
Bytes 2-7 | Keycodes for up to 6 simultaneous key presses

Modifier key | Value
--- | ---
Left Ctrl | 0x01
Left Shift | 0x02
Left Alt | 0x04
Left GUI | 0x08
Right Ctrl | 0x10
Right Shift | 0x20
Right Alt | 0x40
Right GUI | 0x80

USB `Keyboard keycodes` are found in the USB Specifications https://usb.org/sites/default/files/hut1_21.pdf and in many other places online, like https://gist.github.com/MightyPork/6da26e382a7ad91b5496ee55fdc73db2.

For example, the codes for 'G', 'H' and 'I' are 0x0A, 0x0B, and 0x0C respectively.

This is an example that reads touch pads on a DUELink module and then send their status as keyboard arrows key presses.

```py
Asio(1) # Enable Asynchronous Commands
dim b1[8] # keyboard need 8 bytes for one report
 
_p = 0 # press status
_s = 0 # backup status
 
while (1)
    if (TouchUp())
        b1[2] = 0x52
        _p = 1
    end
    if (TouchDown())
        b1[2] = 0x51
        _p = 1
    end
    if (TouchLeft())
        b1[2] = 0x50
        _p = 1
    end
    if (TouchRight())
        b1[2] = 0x4F
        _p = 1
    end
    if _p != _s
        if _p = 1
            hid(1,b1) # send key        
        else
            hid(1,[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]) # release    
        end
        _s = _p
    end
    _p = 0 # reset press status
wend
```
