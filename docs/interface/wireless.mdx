# Wireless


Cut the wire and use DUELink modules wirelessly! This **wireless interface** is accomplished by turning [Wireless ESP32](../products/wlesp32-a) module into a host gateway.

## Non-interface

This page is about using the wireless connection as the interface. It is how a Bluetooth/WiFi connection can be used to control modules wirelessly.

The other option is for [Wireless ESP32](../products/wlesp32-a) to be one of the modules. In this setup, this wireless connection is available to the other modules to the host. A host can be an Arduino or a micro:bit for example.

See [Wireless ESP32](../products/wlesp32-a) product page to learn how to use wireless in a non-interface matter.

## Bluetooth

When using Bluetooth, The established connection creates a (SPP - Serial Port Profile) virtual serial connection. This is very similar to the virtual connection established when using the [USB interface](./usb). You can now, for example, use Python on a PC to access a [daisylink](../engine/daisylink) of modules. To power the modules you can use [Power Hook](../products/adpowerhook-a) or USB adapter, like [USB Host](../products/adusbhook-a), then use USB as a power source.

The module is configured by default for bluetooth connections. No need to configure it. This is the code needed if it was modified.

:::tip
This code assumes the module is loaded with [drivers](../engine/drivers).

```py
# Add code
```

## WiFi

When using WiFi, the [Wireless ESP32](../products/wlesp32-a) module starts a TCP Server. The easiest way to try this server is using a terminal software, such as TeraTerm.

First, we need to load the configuration. For this, we need to connect [Wireless ESP32](../products/wlesp32-a) to USB. You can use one of the many adapters, including [USB Hook](../products/adusbhook-a).

Then use the console to load this config. You will overwrite the default Bluetooth config.

:::tip
This code assumes the module is loaded with [drivers](../engine/drivers).
:::

```py
# Modify to fit your setup
SSID("DUELink")
PASS("123456789")
TCPHook()
```

You can now continue to use USB as a power source, or use something like [Power Hook](../products/adpowerhook-a). Note how the Wireless module is now a host to its [daisylink](../engine/daisylink).

Open TeraTerm and select `TCP/IP` then enter `DUELink` for the `Host` name. Select `Other` from the `Service` options. Set `TCP Port#` to `22`.

Once the connections is established, you can type in commands to control modules. `Echo()` does not work properly as TeraTerm (and most terminals) will only send data when you hit enter. You can enable `local echo` to see what you type! Go ahead and enter `list` and hot enter to see the code listing.
