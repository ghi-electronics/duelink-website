# Wireless


![Wireless ESP32 with hook Connection](pathname:///img/wlesp32-usbhook-connection.png)

Cut the wire and use DUELink modules wirelessly! This **wireless interface** is accomplished by turning [Wireless ESP32](../products/wlesp32-a) module into a host with a gateway interface.

## Non-interface

This page is about using the wireless connection as the interface. It is how a Bluetooth/WiFi connection can be used to control modules wirelessly.

The other option is for [Wireless ESP32](../products/wlesp32-a) to be one of the modules. In this setup, this wireless connection is available to the other modules to the host. A host can be an Arduino or a micro:bit for example.

See [Wireless ESP32](../products/wlesp32-a) product page to learn how to use wireless in a non-interface matter.

## Bluetooth

When using Bluetooth, The established connection creates a (SPP - Serial Port Profile) virtual serial connection. This is very similar to the virtual connection established when using the [USB interface](./usb). You can now, for example, use Python on a PC to access a [daisylink](../engine/daisylink) of modules. To power the modules you can use [Power Hook](../products/adpowerhook-a) or USB adapter, like [USB Host](../products/adusbhook-a), then use USB as a power source.

(1 or 2 images showing one with USB virtual com and one with bluetooth virtual com)


The module is configured by default for bluetooth connections. No need to configure it. This is the code needed if it was modified.

:::tip
This code assumes the module is loaded with [drivers](../engine/drivers).
:::


```py
# Add code
```

## WiFi

When using WiFi, the [Wireless ESP32](../products/wlesp32-a) module starts a TCP Server. The easiest way to try this server is using a terminal software, such as TeraTerm.

First, we need to load the configuration. For this, we need to connect [Wireless ESP32](../products/wlesp32-a) to USB. You can use one of the many adapters.

Then use the console to load this config. You will overwrite th default Bluetooth config.

:::tip
This code assumes the module is loaded with [drivers](../engine/drivers).
:::

```py
# Modify to fit your setup
SSID("DUELink")
PASS("123456789")
TCPHook()
```

You can now continue to use USB as a power source, or use something like [Power Hook](../products/adpowerhook-a). Note how the Wireless module is now a host to its [daisylink](../engine/daisylink).

(image)

Open TeraTerm and select `TCP/IP` then enter `DUELink` for the `Host` name. Select `Other` from the `Service` options. Set `TCP Port#` to `22`.

(image)

Once the connections is established, you can type in commands to control modules. `Echo()` does not work properly as TeraTerm (and most terminals) will only send data when you hit enter. You can enable `local echo` to see what you type! Go ahead and enter `list` and hot enter to see the code listing.
