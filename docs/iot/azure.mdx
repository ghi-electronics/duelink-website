## Azure SDK

Azure SDK is available in multiple languages, right from [Microsoft Azure Downloads](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/). Many of these [coding languages](../language/intro) are also supported by DUELink. A user, for example, can use Python to start with Azure SDK for Python and then add the needed DUELink libraries as shown on [DUELink Python](../language/python) support page.

A [Supported Hardware](../hw/intro) such as a [PC](../hw/pc-laptop) or a [Raspberry Pi](../hw/raspberry-pi) can be used to connect hundreds of sensors and actuators to [Azure IoT Hub](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/iot-hub) with relatively minimal efforts.

In the case of using a [PC](../hw/pc-laptop), we recommend starting with a Microcomputer, such as [DueSTEM](../products/mcduestem-b). The [USB Hook](../products/adusbhook-a) can be used to connect (hook) any of the other DUELink modules.

With the [Raspberry Pi](../hw/raspberry-pi) example, we recommend [DuePi](../products/adduepi-b), which has much to offer on its own but also includes a [Downlink](../interface/downlink) connector for wiring your favorite modules.

## Azure Directly

It is also possible to use [Wireless ESP32](../products/wlesp32-a) module to connect to the internet directly.
