## Azure SDK

Azure SDK is available in multiple languages, right from [Microsoft Azure Downloads](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/). Many of these [coding languages](../language/intro) are also supported by DUELink. A user, for example, can use Python to start with Azure SDK for Python and then add the needed DUELink libraries as show on [DUELink Python](../language/python) support page.

A [Supported Hardware](../hw/intro) such as [PC](../hw/pc-laptop) or a [Raspberry Pi](../hw/raspberry-pi) can be used to connect hundreds of sensors and actuators to [Azure IoT Hub](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/iot-hub), with relatively minimal efforts.

In the case of using a [PC](../hw/pc-laptop), we recommend starting with a Microcomputer, such as [DueSTEM](../catalog/microcomputer/duestem). The [USB Hook](../catalog/accessory/usb-hook) can be used to connect (hook) any of the other DUELink modules.

With the [Raspberry Pi](../hw/raspberry-pi) example, we recommend [DuePi](../catalog/accessory/duepi), which has much to offer on its own but also include a [Downlink](../interface/downlink) connector for wiring your favorite modules.

## Azure Directly

It is also possible to use a DUELink module that has a direct internet connection as a host to a daisylink of DUELink modules. This can be a [Wireless Interface](../interface/wireless) using [Wireless Hook](../catalog/accessory/wireless-hook).

While very possible, this is still under development. If you have the right experience, and do not want to wait, you can program the ESP32 on [Wireless Hook](../catalog/accessory/wireless-hook) to do just that. The ESP32 handles WiFi/MQTT to pipe data to the onboard DUELink chip with standard firmware.
