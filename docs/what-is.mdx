# What is DUELink?


![Product Catalog](pathname:///img/duelink-modules.png)

DUELink revolutionizes electronics innovation with a vast ecosystem of microcomputer, sensor, actuator, LED and display modules—empowering Engineers to prototype faster, Makers to create smarter, and STEM Educators to inspire circuit-coders.

Each DUELink module is a self-contained mini-computer, powered by a Dynamic Universal Extensible DaisyLink, enabling seamless integration with your favorite hardware platforms and coding languages.

Whether you're a seasoned developer using Python or JavaScript, or a beginner exploring with MicroBlocks' drag-and-drop block-coding interface, DUELink makes programming circuits approachable and powerful. And for advanced users, each module can even run standalone scripts—no external controller required.

DUELink works with a range of supported hardware devices: Raspberry Pi, BeagleBoard, Arduino, Microbit, Computers, Phones, and more! Devices connect directly or using one of the many accessories, from a versatile DuePi to a simple USB Hook.

DUELink plays well with other ecosystems, including SparkFun Qwiic and Adafruit STEMMA. Want to go further? Build your own modules using DUELink's Stick or Stamp microcomputers and expand your toolkit your way.

Whether you're designing, tinkering, or teaching, DUELink makes innovation modular, intuitive, and endlessly scalable.

So, can we say **DUELink is Everything?!**

<details>
  <summary>**Every Host:** Arduino, RPI, FEZ, PC, Phone…</summary>

**What do you mean by every host?**

You can continue to use your favorite board and then “link” it to one, or a hundred, DUELink modules. 
We have covered many [supported hardware](./hw/intro) options but you can even go [beyond](./hw/beyond).
</details>

<details>
  <summary>**Every Interface:** USB, SPI, I2C, and UART…</summary>

**Does it really work with every interface?**

Yes…almost! Every single DUELink module supports [multiple interfaces](./interface/intro), including [USB](./interface/usb), 
[Serial UART](./interface/uart), and [I2C](./interface/i2c). That is how these modules connect to your favorite hardware. But then, 
each module has a [Downlink](./interface/downlink) connection allowing you to [Daisylink](./engine/daisylink) hundreds of modules .
</details>

<details>
  <summary>**Every Language:** Python, C#, JavaScript…</summary>

**You couldn't really support every coding language! Could you?**

We support the top [languages](./language/intro) including [Python](./language/python) and 
 [JavaScript](./language/javascript) allowing control over a [PC](./hw/pc-laptop)/ 
a [phone](./hw/phone-tablet) or [Raspberry Pi](./hw/raspberry-pi) / [Arduino](./hw/arduino). However we go beyond that and let you run modules 
[standalone](./language/standalone) in many ways, including [Arduino](./hw/arduino),
[MicroBlocks](./language/microblocks), and the internal [Scripting Language](./engine/scripting).

If [Excel](./language/excel) can control a sensor, then anything can!
</details>

<details>
  <summary>**Every User:** Commercial quality and maker friendly, that works for educators.</summary>

**How can this work for an engineer, but also work for a student?!**

DUELink is designed by commercial engineers who are involved with STEM education. We know what [engineers](./engineers) need 
but also work with [educators](./educators). We do not stop there, we are also [makers](./makers) during our free time.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>**Every Setup:** Standalone, a link master, or slave to a host.</summary>

**How can it run standalone or run with my favorite board/setup?**

Each module has a mini computer allowing it to run [standalone](./language/standalone) using its [Scripting Engine](./engine/scripting). This engine can also be commanded using your favorite [hardware](./hw/intro), such as [Raspberry Pi](./hw/raspberry-pi) or 
[Micro:bit](./hw/microbit) or even control the modules from a [PC](./hw/pc-laptop). 

Still not satisfied? Load the module with [MicroBlocks](./language/microblocks) and use an easy block coding interface, or use 
[Arduino](./hw/arduino) and take advantage of massive community resources.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>**Every Option:** Hundreds of module-options for every need.</summary>

**Where do you get “hundreds of options”?**

We are just getting started and there is a [catalog](./catalog/intro) with 100s of modules available. We dream of a day where there is a DUELink module for every single technology and need. We are not doing it alone! [Third-party modules](./catalog/third-party) are encouraged. We have open [Specifications](./specs) to help you make your own. 

If you do not want to deal with tiny chip soldering, we have a very tiny module for you, called [Stick](./catalog/microcomputer/stick). Another one is [Stamp](./catalog/microcomputer/stamp), which is the size of… you guessed it… a stamp!
</details>

<details>
  <summary>**Every Budget:** Designed with low-cost as a requirement.</summary>

**Any budget? I am not seeing a $1 module!**

Yes, modules that are designed, manufactured, and supported in Michigan, USA are not at “Alibaba-level” pricing. The good news is that the modules are priced 
right if you factor in the time needed to get the job done effectively. But hold on, you can also have a hybrid option where basic needs can be met by the “$1 button” but then utilize DUELink's advanced modules for other tasks. Of course, we would love it if you can support us with all your needs as this will help in covering the research and development of future modules that you might really need one day.

<details>
  <summary>**Every Ecosystem:** Adafruit STEMMA, SparkFun Qwiic…</summary>

**How does DUELink work with any Ecosystem?**

If you are using an ecosystem that uses a JST connector, like Adafruit STEMMA QT or Sparkfun Qwiic, than you are half way there! These ecosystems use  I2C bus to connect to their modules. Since one of the supported interfaces is [I2C](./interface/i2c), DUELink and these ecosystems 
can play together nicely as explained on the [I2C](./interface/i2c) page. Similarly, systems like Seeed Studio Grove will work but you will need an adaptor cable due to the different connector size.

If you are using something very different from JST/I2C connections then that works separately and you only 
need a standard [Connector](./catalog/accessory/connector) to start [wiring](./catalog/accessory/cable) modules. We even have a [Breakout](./catalog/accessory/breakout) for easier wiring. You have the option to use one of the [Interfaces](./interface/intro), including [USB](./interface/usb), [I2C](./interface/i2c), and [Serial UART](./interface/uart)
</details>

<details>
  <summary>**Everywhere Mounting:** 5mm-pitch holes (like Gadgeteer did).</summary>

**Can modules be mounted?**

A universal rule is the [specification](./specs) of 5mm-pitched-holes. This allows for universal mounting, like with the available [Holey boards](./catalog/accessory/holey-board).

We even give you some [mounting hardware](./catalog/accessory/mount-hw) options! This rule helps when designing 3D packages or when building laser-cut enclosures.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>**Everywhere Engine:** World's tiniest engine that includes scripting, graphics, file system, and much more.</summary>

**How can a simple engine go everywhere?**

The DUELink [engine](./engine/intro) is very powerful for its size! It lives on every single module and includes a [Scripting Language](./engine/scripting)
with an extensive [Standard Library](./engine/stdlib) and support for [Graphics](./engine/graphics), [File System](./engine/filesystem), and far beyond!
