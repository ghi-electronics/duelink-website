DUELink revolutionizes electronics innovation with a vast [ecosystem](./catalog/products) of smart electronic building blocks, empowering [Engineers](./engineers) to prototype faster, [Makers](./makers) to create smarter, and STEM [Educators](./educators) to inspire circuit-coders.

Each DUELink building block module is a self-contained mini-computer with a [scripting](./engine/scripting) engine allowing it to run standalone or tether to your favorite [hardware platform](./hw/intro) and [coding language](./language/intro).

You could be a seasoned developer using [Python](./language/python) and [JavaScript](./language/javascript), or a beginner exploring with [MicroBlocks'](./language/microblocks) drag-and-drop block-coding. DUELink makes programming circuits approachable and powerful. 

No matter if you need one module, or need [Daisylink](./engine/daisylink) of modules, DUELink tethers to a wide range of [supported hardware](./hw/intro) devices: [Raspberry Pi](./hw/raspberry-pi), [BeagleBoard](./hw/beagleboard), [Arduino](./hw/arduino), [micro:bit](./hw/microbit), [Computers](./hw/pc-laptop), [Phones](./hw/phone-tablet), and [beyond](./hw/beyond)!

The [Daisylink](./engine/daisylink) on DUELink works with other [I2C](./interface/i2c) module ecosystems, including Arduino Modulino, SparkFun Qwiic and Adafruit STEMMA. Go further and expand your toolkit by [building your own modules](./catalog/third-party) using DUELink [Stick](./products/mcstick-a) and [Stamp](./products//mcstamp-b.mdx) microcomputers.

Whether you're designing, tinkering, or teaching, DUELink makes innovation modular, intuitive, and endlessly scalable.

<details>
  <summary>DUELink product catalog includes sensors, actuators, and displays that can harmonically work together!</summary>

The growing [catalog](./catalog/products) includes 100s of available modules. We dream of a day where there is a DUELink module for every single technology and need. We are not doing it alone! [Third-party modules](./catalog/third-party) are encouraged. We have open [Specifications](./specs) to help you make your own. 

If you do not want to deal with tiny chip soldering, we have a very tiny module for you called [Stick](./products/mcstick-a). Another one is [Stamp](./products//mcstamp-b.mdx), which is the size of, you guessed it, a stamp!

Tether your favorite [hardware](./hw/intro) and use one of the supported [languages](./language/intro), including [Python](./language/python) and [JavaScript](./language/javascript). Moreover, modules can run [standalone](./language/standalone) using [Arduino](./hw/arduino), [MicroBlocks](./language/microblocks), and the internal [Scripting Language](./engine/scripting).

If [Excel](./language/excel) can control a sensor, then anything can!

<details>
  <summary>Tether modules over USB/I2C/UART. Connect one or Daisylink them all!</summary>

Every single DUELink module supports [multiple interfaces](./interface/intro), including [USB](./interface/usb), [Serial UART](./interface/uart), and [I2C](./interface/i2c). But then, each module has a [Downlink](./interface/downlink) connection allowing you to [Daisylink](./engine/daisylink) hundreds of modules.

<details>
  <summary>Each module has an internal engine with a scripting language.</summary>


The DUELink [engine](./engine/intro) is very powerful for its size! It lives on every single module and includes a [Scripting Language](./engine/scripting) with an extensive [Standard Library](./engine/stdlib) and support for [Graphics](./engine/graphics), [File System](./engine/filesystem), and beyond!

Each module is a mini-computer allowing it to run [standalone](./language/standalone) using its [Scripting Engine](./engine/scripting). This engine can also be commanded by your favorite tethered [hardware](./hw/intro), such as [Raspberry Pi](./hw/raspberry-pi) or [Micro:bit](./hw/microbit) or even control the modules from a [PC](./hw/pc-laptop). 

Still want more? Load the module with [MicroBlocks](./language/microblocks) and use an easy block coding interface, or use [Arduino](./hw/arduino) and take advantage of massive community resources.

DUELink [specifications](./specs) are available to help you in making [your own modules](./catalog/third-party). For 3D-printed and laser-cut enclosures, a universal rule is in how holes are added to each module. This allows for universal mounting, like with the available [Holey boards](./products/axholey). We even give you some [mounting hardware](./products/axmnt) options!

## DUELink with Qwiic, Stemma QT, and Modulino

<details>
  <summary>Works with non-DUELink modules, such as SparkFun Qwiic, Adafruit STEMMA QT, and Arduino Modulino.</summary>

Microcomputers that use JST connectors, like Sparkfun Qwiic, Adafruit STEMMA QT, or Arduino Modulino work directly with DUELink modules using [I2C](./interface/i2c) interface. Similarly, systems like Seeed Studio Grove will work, but you will need an adapter cable due to the different connector size.

Similarly, non-DUELink sensors and actuators can connect to a DUELink [downlink](./interface/downlink) connector.

<details>
  <summary>We strive to be environmentally friendly 🌿 and reduce excess electronic waste where we can.</summary>

Let's face it.  You probably have several USB C cables laying around as they are commonly used with many of your electronic devices today. Therefore, we are only including USB C cables with select Kits and Specialty Items. 

Similarly, DUELink JST cables are not included with individual modules. To make it easy for you, however, we offer various length [cables](/docs/products/axcbl). 

As a great starting point, DUELink Kits and Bundles will include everything you need.
