# What is DUELink?

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}>
![DUELink Logo](pathname:///img/duelinklogo.png)
</div>

DUELink revolutionizes electronics innovation with a vast [ecosystem](./catalog/intro) of smart electronic building blocks, empowering [Engineers](./engineers) to prototype faster, [Makers](./makers) to create smarter, and STEM [Educators](./educators) to inspire circuit-coders.

Each DUELink building block module is a self-contained mini-computer, powered by a [daisylink](./engine/daisylink) that seamlessly integrates with your favorite [hardware platform](./hw/intro) and [coding language](./language/intro). These modules even include an internal [scripting](./engine/scripting) engine allowing them to run standalone, no external controller required.

No matter if you're a seasoned developer using [Python](./language/python) or [JavaScript](./language/javascript), or a beginner exploring with [MicroBlocks'](./language/microblocks) drag-and-drop block-coding, DUELink makes programming circuits approachable and powerful. DUELink modules connect to a wide range of [supported hardware](./hw/intro) devices: [Raspberry Pi](./hw/raspberry-pi), [BeagleBoard](./hw/beagleboard), [Arduino](./hw/arduino), [micro:bit](./hw/microbit), [Computers](./hw/pc-laptop), [Phones](./hw/phone-tablet), and [beyond](./hw/beyond)!

The [daisylink](./engine/daisylink) on DUELink works with other [I2C](./interface/i2c) module ecosystems, including SparkFun Qwiic and Adafruit STEMMA. Want to go further? [Build your own](./catalog/third-party) modules using DUELink's [Stick](./products/mcstick-a) or [Stamp](./products//mcstamp-b.mdx) microcomputer to expand your toolkit.

Whether you're designing, tinkering, or teaching, DUELink makes innovation modular, intuitive, and endlessly scalable.

## Product Catalog
</div>

![Product Catalog](pathname:///img/duelink-modules.png)

<details>
  <summary>DUELink product catalog includes sensors, actuators, and displays that can harmonically work together!</summary>

We are just getting started and there is already a [catalog](./catalog/intro) with 100s of modules available. We dream of a day where there is a DUELink module for every single technology and need. We are not doing it alone! [Third-party modules](./catalog/third-party) are encouraged. We have open [Specifications](./specs) to help you make your own. 

If you do not want to deal with tiny chip soldering, we have a very tiny module for you, called [Stick](./products/mcstick-a). Another one is [Stamp](./products//mcstamp-b.mdx), which is the size of, you guessed it, a stamp!

## Supported Hardware

<details>
  <summary>Modules work with many Supported Hardware devices, such as ESP32/Arduino/Raspberry-Pi, and even works right from a PC!</summary>

We want you to continue to use your favorite board and then “link” it to one, or a hundred, of DUELink modules. We have covered many [supported hardware](./hw/intro) options but you can even go [beyond](./hw/beyond).

## Coding Languages
</div>
![Coding languages](pathname:///img/languages.png)

<details>
  <summary>Users can select one of the coding languages, but they can also run programs standalone!</summary>

We support the top [languages](./language/intro) including [Python](./language/python) and 
 [JavaScript](./language/javascript) allowing control over a [PC](./hw/pc-laptop)/ 
a [phone](./hw/phone-tablet) or [Raspberry Pi](./hw/raspberry-pi) / [Arduino](./hw/arduino). However we go beyond that and let you run modules 
[standalone](./language/standalone) in many ways, including [Arduino](./hw/arduino),
[MicroBlocks](./language/microblocks), and the internal [Scripting Language](./engine/scripting).

If [Excel](./language/excel) can control a sensor, then anything can!

## DaisyLink over USB/I2C/UART
</div>

![Daisylink](pathname:///img/daisylink.png)

<details>
  <summary>Connect modules over USB/I2C/UART. Connect one or daisylink them all!</summary>

Yes…almost! Every single DUELink module supports [multiple interfaces](./interface/intro), including [USB](./interface/usb), 
[Serial UART](./interface/uart), and [I2C](./interface/i2c). That is how these modules connect to your favorite hardware. But then, 
each module has a [Downlink](./interface/downlink) connection allowing you to [Daisylink](./engine/daisylink) hundreds of modules .

## Internal Scripting Engine
</div>

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}>
```py
x=100
PrintLn(x)
PrintLn("Hello World")
```
</div>

<details>
  <summary>Each module has an internal engine with a scripting language.</summary>


The DUELink [engine](./engine/intro) is very powerful for its size! It lives on every single module and includes a [Scripting Language](./engine/scripting)
with an extensive [Standard Library](./engine/stdlib) and support for [Graphics](./engine/graphics), [File System](./engine/filesystem), and far beyond!

Each module has a mini computer allowing it to run [standalone](./language/standalone) using its [Scripting Engine](./engine/scripting). This engine can also be commanded using your favorite [hardware](./hw/intro), such as [Raspberry Pi](./hw/raspberry-pi) or 
[Micro:bit](./hw/microbit) or even control the modules from a [PC](./hw/pc-laptop). 

Still not satisfied? Load the module with [MicroBlocks](./language/microblocks) and use an easy block coding interface, or use 
[Arduino](./hw/arduino) and take advantage of massive community resources.

## Specifications

<details>
  <summary>Open specs to help you integrate, or make your own modules!</summary>

A universal rule is the [specification](./specs) of 5mm-pitched-holes. This allows for universal mounting, like with the available [Holey boards](./products/axholeyboards-a).

We even give you some [mounting hardware](./products/axmounting-a) options! This rule helps when designing 3D packages or when building laser-cut enclosures.

## DULElink with STEMMA and Qwiic
</div>

![DUELink STEM I2C qwiic stemmaQT](pathname:///img/qwiic-stemma-i2c.png)


<details>
  <summary>Works with non-DUELink modules, such as Adafruit STEMMA and SparkFun Qwiic.</summary>

If you are using an ecosystem that uses a JST connector, like Adafruit STEMMA QT or Sparkfun Qwiic, than you are half way there! These ecosystems use  I2C bus to connect to their modules. Since one of the supported interfaces is [I2C](./interface/i2c), DUELink and these ecosystems 
can play together nicely as explained on the [I2C](./interface/i2c) page. Similarly, systems like Seeed Studio Grove will work but you will need an adapter cable due to the different connector size.

If you are using something very different from JST/I2C connections then that works separately and you only 
need a standard [Connector](./products/axconnectors-a) to start [wiring](./products/axcables-a) modules. We even have a [Breakout](./products/adbreakout-a) for easier wiring. You have the option to use one of the [Interfaces](./interface/intro), including [USB](./interface/usb), [I2C](./interface/i2c), and [Serial UART](./interface/uart)
