## Play hard, but play safe!

DUELink modules are exposed electronic circuits, with few things to consider for safety:

* Do not leave unsupervised with children under 13 or pets.
* Be careful when handling circuits, they usually have sharp edges.
* Keep away from water and high moisture. Similar to a phones,  DUELink modules do not like water.
* Do not short on-module connections with conductive metal objects.
* Immediately disconnect a circuit that causes a smell or seems too hot.
* PLAY HARD, but PLAY SAFE!!

## Batteries

ALWAYS disconnect batteries when storing circuits. Energized circuits can short and lead to overheating and possible fire. When using exposed circuits, extra precaution is necessary. Read the warning carefully and contact us before use if unsure or have any concerns.

* DO NOT use product while charging.
* DO NOT overcharge the battery. Unplug charger when full.
* DO NOT leave a charging circuit unattended.
* DO NOT place close to metal or moisture, which can cause harmful connections to batteries and circuits.
* DO NOT use if battery is leaking, damaged, heated, deformed, discolored, smelly or any other abnormal observation. Unplug charger immediately.
* DO NOT use the battery with the other circuits.
* DO NOT puncture, short circuit, reverse connect, weld, impact, crush, or throw the battery.
* DO NOT use the battery in a strong static and magnetic field environment.
* DO NOT let it freeze or use in direct sun or heat. Keep the battery in a 0°C ~ 35°C environment.
* DO NOT leave with small children or pets.
