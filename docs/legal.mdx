# Legal & Licensing


Just like all of GHI Electronics' offers, the entire DUELink ecosystem is designed to be first-class commercial-quality Hardware/Software combo. DUELink [Specs](./specs) are available for you to make your own DUELink-compatible [Third Party](./catalog/third-party) modules.

All necessary components are made open-source, such as DUElink [Console](console), hundreds of DUELink Module schematics, and the [Coding Languages](language/intro) libraries. The [Internal Engine](engine/intro) firmware sources are not open; however, the compiled binaries are provided under [Downloads](downloads), available freely for commercial and non-commercial use.
