# Engineers

DUELink serves electrical and embedded engineering in multiple ways, from initial **prototyping** to post production **expandability** options.

## Rapid Prototyping

Build prototypes and proof of concepts in minutes vs days, at an extremely low-cost. Let's say you have a quick need for a device that connect to a vehicle with these requirements:

1. Power from a car battery.
1. Capture CAN bus messages.
1. Read current position from GPS.
1. Record a log on a USB memory Stick.
1. Show information on a color display.

Put the soldering iron aside and grab a [Holey Board](./products/axholey) instead! Here is your project done in a couple of hours!

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}>
![Vehicle project](pathname:///img/vehicle-project.webp)
</div>

On the software front, each module has a mini-computer with a built in engine! Simple ASCII human-readable commands can show graphics on the display and record files on a USB memory stick! We even provide libraries to support the impressive [Standard Library](./engine/stdlib) using almost any [coding language](./language/intro).

## Expandability

By adding a tiny JST connector, you will magically bring a whole level of expandability to your projects. Just imagine how versatile designs will be when you are able to tether any [DUELink Catalog](./catalog/products) module to your circuit. 

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}>
![downlink](pathname:///img/downlink.webp)
</div>

This one connector allows you to tether to one or to a chain of modules.

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}>
![dueduino link](pathname:///img/dueduino-uplink.webp)
</div>

Chaining modules is possible using [Daisylink](./engine/daisylink).

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}>
![uplink downlink](pathname:///img/uplink-downlink.webp)
</div>

The [internal engine](./engine/intro) handles this Daisylink. You only need to wire [I2C](./interface/i2c) or [UART](./interface/uart) to a compatible JST connector.

## Advanced Modules

DUELink ecosystem includes some complex modules that can advance your design with relatively minimal work, turning weeks of frustration into hours of progress!

All modules, including the onces listed below, are controlled using ASCII commands. We even provide libraries to handle these ASCII commands for almost all [coding languages](./language/intro), including [Python](./language/python), [JavaScript](./language/javascript), [.NET](./language/dotnet).

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

<table>
 <tr>
<td width='50%'>
    <img alt="Back" src="/img/usbhost.webp" />
    The module already includes all FAT file system and USB Host software libraries internally. You simply send a file command, and the module will do the rest for you. There are also SD and Micro SD module options as well.
    <Button
        style={{ margin: "10px", color: "white" }}
        label="USB Host"
        link="./products/stusbhost-b"
    />
</td>
<td width='50%'>
    <img alt="Size" src="/img/portal-cp70.webp" />
    This full color 800x600 7" display has advanced Bridgetek graphics coprocessor  to handle image decoding,font rendering, and shape drawing. It also includes a capacitive touch screen.

    <Button
        style={{ margin: "10px", color: "white" }}
        label="Portal CP70"
        link="./products/dsprtlcp70-b"
    />
</td>
</tr>
 <tr>
<td width='50%'>
    <img alt="Size" src="/img/hdmi.webp" />
    The same tine JST connector brings HDMI to your design! The onboard Bridgetek graphics coprocessor renders high-definition graphics. Yes, any design can have a 50" monitor now!

    <Button
        style={{ margin: "10px", color: "white" }}
        label="HDMI"
        link="./products/dshdmi-b"
    />
</td>
<td width='50%'>
    <img alt="Back" src="/img/stick.webp" />
    Want something else? Make your own module using this very small 13x13mm "stick"! It includes Uplink and Downlink connectors and all the IOs you need. Solder it directly on your board or use pin headers to plug into a breadboard.  
    <Button
        style={{ margin: "10px", color: "white" }}
        label="Stick"
        link="./products/mcstick-a"
    />
</td>
</tr>

## Standalone

You know by now that you can tether DUELink modules to any [hardware](./hw/intro) and use almost any [coding language](./language/intro)! But, since every DUELink module is a mini-computer, it is also possible to program these modules to run standalone. This can be done using a bare-bone C++ project.

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}>
![c++](pathname:///img/cplusplus.webp)
</div>

Or, you can also use the Arduino ecosystem for en easier path. 

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}>

</div>

Visit the [standalone](./language/standalone) page to learn more.

## Standard Sizing

The standard hole sizes and placement pitch allow for easier enclosure designs. See [Specifications](./specs) for more details.

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}>
![Hole Specs](pathname:///img/duelink-hole-specs.webp)
</div>

Move your prototypes into a 3D printed design a laser-cut enclosure.

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}>
![Laser Cut Enclosure](pathname:///img/laser-enclosure.webp)
</div>

See the DUELink [Specs](./specs) for details and evolve into making your own [Third-Party Modules](./catalog/third-party).
