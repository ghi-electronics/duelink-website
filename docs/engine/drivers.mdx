# Driver Script


The DUELink [Standard Library](../engine/stdlib) include a long list of commonly used features. However, it's not made to be module-specific. For example, an Accelerometer might use the SPI bus. The standard library includes SPI bus support, but it is unaware of the Accelerometer. This is where a modules' Driver Script comes in to play. In this setup, the driver will include a `ReadX()` function to read the acceleration on the X axis. This driver's `ReadX()` function uses the standard library's SPI bus facilities. Since these driver scripts are directly related to the module they are loaded on, `ReadX()` might also be a function provided by a joystick module to read the joystick position in the X axis!

Driver Scripts and their API docs are listed under the `Drivers` tab on each product's page. While not required, inspecting the driver's script helps with a deeper understanding of the module's internal functionality.

:::tip
Modules function just fine without drivers, just use the [standard library](./stdlib)! For example, use `statled()` to control the STAT LED. However, adding drivers greatly simplify the use of modules.

## Loading Drivers

The [Console's](../console) `Driver` top-menu option can automatically detect the connected module and load the appropriate driver script. This of course only work on modules that already have DUELink official firmware loaded.

:::tip
It is advisable to always load/update the driver script after any firmware update.

## Regions

We take advantage of the [Region](./regions) feature and load Driver Scripts in region 0. This allows the user to load their own application in region 1.

You can use the console's script window to see and modify the driver in region 0. Select region 0 from the regions window.

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}>
![Driver Button](pathname:///img/select-driver-region.webp)
</div>

The Console will now load and show region 0 content.

## Driver Version

Driver scripts always include `DVer()` function that returns the driver's version number. If the function did not exist then the driver was not loaded!

You can access `DVer()` similar to all other functions, like from the immediate window for example.

## MicroBlocks Drivers

Just like all other [coding languages](../language/intro), a board is tethered to DUELink module(s) can access the module's driver scripts. However, when using MicroBlocks standalone, you will need MicroBlocks specific drivers. We already provide specific drivers for [education](../educators)-focused boards. Needing drivers for other boards in stand alone mode is not a common use, but we do provide standalone samples to get you started. The driver script can also help in understanding the module's internals. See [MicroBlocks](../language/microblocks) for more details.

## Arduino

The standalone samples found on each module's page is a great starting point. The driver script can then be used to expand the sample into your desired functionality. Note that this is not needed when modules are tethered to an Arduino-compatible board. That board will simply command the module's drivers over an [interface](../interface/intro). The [Arduino](../hw/arduino) page has more info.
