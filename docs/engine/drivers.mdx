# Driver Scripts


The DUELink [Standard Library](../engine/stdlib) include a long list of commonly used features. However, it's not made to be module-specific. For example, an Accelerometer might use the SPI bus. The standard library includes SPI bus support, but it is unaware of the Accelerometer. This is where the modules' Driver Scripts comes in play. In this setup, the driver can include a `ReadX()` function to read the acceleration on the X axis for example. This driver's `ReadX()` function uses the standard library's SPI bus facilities. Since these driver scripts are directly related to the module they are loaded on, `ReadX()` might also be a function provided by a joystick module to read the joystick position in the X axis!

Driver Scripts and their API docs are listed under the `Drivers` tab on each product's page. While not required, inspecting the driver's script helps with a deeper understanding of the module's internal functionality.

:::tip
Modules function just fine without drivers, just use the [standard library](./stdlib)! For example, use `statled()` to control the STAT LED. However, adding drivers greatly simplify the use of modules.

## Loading Drivers

The [Console's](../console) `Driver` top-menu option can automatically detect the connected module and load the appropriate driver scripts. This of course only work on modules that already have DUELink official firmware loaded.

:::tip
It is advisable to always load/update the driver scripts after any firmware update.

## Regions

We take advantage of the [Region](./regions) feature and load Driver Scripts into Region `0-Driver`. This allows the user to load their own application into Region `1-User`.

You can use the console's `Region Panel` to see and modify any of the regions.

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}>
![Driver Button](pathname:///img/select-driver-region.webp)
</div>

The Console will now load and show region 0 content, which you can modify and write back. See [Region](./regions) for more details.

## Driver Version

Driver scripts always include `DVer()` function that returns the driver's version number. If the function did not exist then the driver was not loaded!

You can access `DVer()` similar to all other functions, like from the immediate window for example.

## MicroBlocks Drivers

Just like all other [coding languages](../language/intro), a board that is tethered to DUELink module(s) can access the module's driver scripts. However, when using MicroBlocks standalone, you will need MicroBlocks specific drivers. That is for the module itself and not for other tethered modules. We already provide specific drivers for [education](../educators)-focused boards. Needing drivers for other boards in stand alone mode is not a common use, but we do provide standalone samples to get you started. The driver scripts is a good reference to help in making your own MicroBlocks drivers. See [MicroBlocks](../language/microblocks) for more details.

## Arduino Drivers

The Arduino standalone samples found on individual modules' pages is a great starting point. You can then use the the driver scripts to expand that standalone sample into your desired functionality. Note that none of this is needed when modules are tethered to an Arduino-running board. That Arduino-running board will simply command the module's over an [interface](../interface/intro). The [Arduino](../hw/arduino) page has more info.
