# Regions

The memory area that holds scripts can be split into regions. This allows users to erase and modify specific regions. For example, a region can carry the module [drivers](./drivers), where a second region can be the user code.

The interpreter treats all regions as one. Having regions is helpful for managing what parts of code can be erased,  modified, and viewed.

This feature is used by default on all modules, where region 0 is loaded by us at production, containing that module's specific [drivers](./drivers). This way, you can now record (load) your own code without erasing/modifying the drivers.
 
For example, display drivers include `GetW` function to return the display width.

## Regions Panel

The `Regions` Panel in the [Console](../console.mdx) contains all the information and tasks you'll need to control and use regions. When you connect a new module, region `0 - Driver` contains the driver loaded at the factory. This is shown by the memory used in that region. There may also be test code loaded into region `1 - User`. 

Buttons along the panel control the action. `Add Region`, `List All`, and `Erase All`. You can select a specific region by clicking on the region.

## Add Region

`Add Region` button is used when there is no region `1 - User` code on the micro such as when a user `Erases All`. 

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}>
![Add Region](pathname:///img/console-add-region.webp)
</div>

This creates a new region labeled `1 - User`. This region is separate from the `0 - driver` region.
The editor window displays the code inside our selected region. In a newly created `User` region, the editor window will be empty and ready for your program. If code already exists in the `User` region, it can be modified and saved in that same region. 

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}>
![User Region](pathname:///img/console-user-region.webp)
</div>

Once we add a region, the memory size of the region `0 - Driver` will be locked and the remaining memory will be available inside `1- User` for our program.  

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}>
![Region Memory](pathname:///img/regions-memory.webp)
</div>

We can now create our program in this region separate from the `Driver`. Type your program and hit the `record` button. This will place your code in the `1 - User` region only. 
 
<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}>
![Record Region](pathname:///img/console-record-region.webp)
</div>

After recording, the `Regions` panel will update the memory used and available. 

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}>
![User Memory](pathname:///img/user-memory.webp)
</div>

If we need to modify the driver, we can load the driver in the editor window by clicking on `0 - Driver` in the `Regions` panel.

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}>
![Select Driver Region](pathname:///img/select-driver-region.webp)
</div>

This will prompt us to replace the code in the editor with the `0 - Driver`. We can now edit the `Driver` section and record it when complete. 

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}>
![Load Driver Region](pathname:///img/load-driver-region.webp)
</div>

 To go back to the `User` code, we only need to click on `1 - User` and load its code into the editor.

---
## List All

Clicking the `List All` button will open a window containing code in all our regions.


<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}>
![List All](pathname:///img/regions-list-all.webp)
</div>

Using the `List` button on the top menu lists the only the code currently in the selected region. 

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}>
![List Button](pathname:///img/due-list.webp)
</div>

---

## Erase All

When clicking the `Erase All` button, this erases both `0 - Driver` and `1 - User` regions together.

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}>
![Erase All](pathname:///img/erase-all.webp)
</div>

 `Erase All` is useful when `0 - Driver` code has grown beyond what was allocated after adding region `1 - User`. You can now enter the larger code into region `0 - Driver` then `Add Region` afterwards. The system will reallocate the size of region `0 - Driver` to what is necessary (to the nearest allowed block) and then leave the remaining memory to region `1 - User`.

 :::tip
 While it is theoretically possible to have more than one region, we only support 2 regions to keep it manageable.
