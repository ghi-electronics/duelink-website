# Internal Engine


DUELink modules run an Internal Engine that is used to handle commands over multiple [Interfaces](../interface/intro). It also manages and handles [DaisyLink](./daisylink) modules on the [Downlink](../interface/downlink) socket.

The engine also allows the module to run [Standalone](../language/standalone).

All above is possible via the built-in DUELink [Scripting Engine](./scripting).

The DUELink Engine has two modes `Immediate Mode`, where commands are executed immediately, and `Record Mode` where commands are stored internally in the module.

DUELink [Console](../console) handles both modes without the users needing to understand any details. This section helps in understanding the engine internals.

---

## Immediate Mode

`Immediate Mode` is ideal for sending a single line command to trigger an actuator into action or read sensor data. For example, a command can be `StatLed(200,200,50)`, to blink the status LED 50 times with a 200ms on/off interval.

It is possible to send multiple commands in a single `Immediate Mode` shot by adding `:` between commands. For example: `StatLed(200,200,50):Print("DUELink")`.

To test the inter-working of the engine manually, we will use a terminal software instead of using [Console](../console). Open terminal software and connect it to the serial port presented by the connected DUELink module. We like [Tera Term](https://teratermproject.github.io/index-en.html).

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}>
![Tera Term](pathname:///img/teraterm-logo.webp)
</div>

The first thing you do is hit `enter`. This is required by the module on power up so it can detect the correct [Interface](../interface/intro). This will result with `>` prompt. It is possible that a module is running an internal script with an infinite loop, causing it to not respond to commands. In this case, pressing the `escape` key will terminate the running internal script.

To be safe, just hit `enter` then `escape`! You will for sure see `>` prompt coming back. The device is now ready to accept commands in `Immediate Mode`. 

By default, the device will not echo back what you enter. You can either enable echo from the device using `Echo(1)` command or by using local echo feature in the terminal software. 

:::note
Immediate Mode is the default mode on power up.
:::

Type `Print("Hello World")` and hit enter. The engine will execute the `Print` command and show `Hello World`.

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}>
![Tera Term](pathname:///img/teraterm.webp)
</div>

Entering `>` is the command to switch to `Immediate Mode`. Keep a note of this once you switch to `Recording Mode` later.

:::tip
The engine handles backspaces and left/right arrows to help in editing the entered commands. It even has entered-command-history that can be fetched using up and down arrow keys.
:::

Commands are entered manually for demonstration and testing. However, in normal use `Immediate Mode` commands come from one of the [Supported Hardware](../hw/intro) over one of the [Interfaces](../interface/intro).

---

## Record Mode

`Record Mode` takes the received commands and stores them internally. Those commands can be executed later using the `run` command. Use `list` to see a list of recorded commands, and `new` to erase everything and start new.

The `Record mode` is entered using the `$` command. This will also switch the prompt to `$`. All statements entered are stored internally and _not_ executed.

The engine will also automatically `run` a program on power up, if it finds one!

:::note
The commands `run`, `list`, and `new` are never recorded! They are used to handle the recorded program.
:::

Go ahead and enter `$` and press the enter key.
<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}>
![Tera Term Record Mode](pathname:///img/teraterm-record.webp)
</div>

Add three lines of `Print` commands. Nothing will get executed as those commands are getting stored internally, not executed. When finished, use `list` to see the commands.

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}>
![Tera Term Print](pathname:///img/teraterm-print.webp)
</div>

Use `run` to run the program.

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}>
![Tera Term Run](pathname:///img/teraterm-run.webp)
</div>

Add another command to the list then try to `run` again.

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}>
![Tera Term Add Item and Run](pathname:///img/teraterm-additem-run.webp)
</div>

Use `new` to erase the program. Verify the program is removed using `list`.

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}>
![Tera Term New](pathname:///img/teraterm-erase.webp)
</div>

:::note
It is not possible to modify individual lines once recorded. This is not a problem when using the [Console](../console) as it sends the program complete in one shot.
:::

We can run a program that runs indefinitely using loops.

```py
@Loop
Print("Hello")
Print(" world")
Print(" 123!!")
Goto Loop
```

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}>
![Tera Term Loop](pathname:///img/teraterm-loop.webp)
</div>

A running program can be terminated by hitting the `escape` key. Hit ESC, then `new` to erase the program. Verify using `list`.

Recording programs are either used to run the module [Standalone](../language/standalone) or to extend the module's functionality using [Drivers](./drivers). When a module has a recorded program (driver) to extend its functionality, and those extra functions are used in immediate mode, we call this `Hybrid Mode`.

---

## Hybrid Mode

There is no `Hybrid Mode` exactly, but you can combine both `Immediate Mode` and `Record Mode` to extend the system with additional commands. Say we want to extend the system with a `Hello()` function. We can `record` this extension that can be executed `immediately`.

Enter recoding mode then start a `new` program. Then enter this program:

```py
fn Hello(b1)
Print("Hello ")
PrintLn(b1)
fend
```

Now, `list` the program to make sure it was recorded properly.

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}>
![Tera Term Function](pathname:///img/teraterm-function.webp)
</div>

Switch to `Immediate Mode`  and enter `Hello("John Due")`.

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}>
![Tera Term Function Print](pathname:///img/teraterm-function-print.webp)
</div>

This is exactly how hundreds of modules provide user-friendly [drivers](./drivers). They all have a recorded script that handles module-specific tasks. Then these drivers commands can be executed from a [Supported Hardware](../hw/intro) over one of the [Interfaces](../interface/intro).

## Asynchronous Immediate

When the system busy running an infinite loop, it is possible to inject other commands to run asynchronously. Use `Asio(1)` to enable this feature.

Consider this program that loops and print the global variable `_x` every 500ms.

```py
Asio(1)
while 1
PrintLn(_x)
Wait(500)
wend
```

With Asynchronous immediate enabled, we can now inject `_x=5` at any time to change the output to 5.

This can also be used to call functions and even run loops! Any valid single-line commands can be injected asynchronously.

This is a simple program that prints whatever is in `a1` every 500ms.

```py
Asio(1)
fn SetA1(a2)
a1 = a2
fend

SetA1("Hello")

while 1
PrintLn(a1)
Wait(500)
wend
```

Now we can inject `SetA1("DUELink")`. Of course, you can just do `a1[]="Try it"`, but we used a function to show the possibilities.
