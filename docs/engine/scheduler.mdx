# Scheduler


DUELink Engine includes a scheduler to help execute tasks repeatedly. Use `SStart` to start scheduling a function. The arguments are `SStart(func, time, count)`, where 'func' is the function to schedule, `time` is the delay between executions, and finally `count` is for the scheduler repeat count.

Things to consider:

1. Schedulers only run if there is a running program. Terminating the main program will automatically stop schedulers.
2. Set `count` to `0` to run forever.
3. The scheduler triggers `func` function with no passed arguments. Only use `func` with no arguments.

You can check the current status of a scheduler using `SStat(func)`. The returned value shows remaining count for the scheduler, a value of `-1` means the scheduler is running forever.

It is possible to abort a schedule at any time using `SAbort(func)`.


```py
_i=0
_c = 0
SStart("Blink", 1000, 5)

# Main program loop
while 1
    PrintLn("stat: ", SStat("Blink"), " - Count: ", _c)
   _c=_c+1
  end
  wait(100)
  # You can for example use a button SAbort("Blink")
wend

fn Blink()
  Println("Go Scheduler! - ", _i)
  _i=_i+1
fend
```
