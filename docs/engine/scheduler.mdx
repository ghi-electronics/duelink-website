# Scheduler

---

DUELink Engine includes a scheduler to help execute tasks repeatedly. Use `SStart` to start scheduling a function. The arguments are `SStart(func, time, count)`, where 'func' is the function to schedule, `time` is the delay between executions, and finally `count` is for the scheduler repeat count.

You can check the current status of a scheduler using `SStat(func)`. The returned value shows remaining count for the scheduler.

It is possible to to abort a schedule at any time using `SAbort(func)`.


```py
_i = 0
SStart("Blink", 100, 50)

while 1
  if (_i % 10) = 0: PrintLn("stat: ", SStat("Blink")) :_i=_i+1 :end
  # If button is pressed, SAbort("Blink")
wend

fn Blink()
  DWrite(0, _i&1)# status LED is always on pin 0
  _i=_i+1
fend
```
