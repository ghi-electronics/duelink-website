USB Client is similar to [USB Host](../../products/stusbhost-b) but works the other way around! Using USB Client, you can connect a DUELink setup to a PC. The module presents itself to the PC as one of the common USB classes, such as a Keyboard.

This is no longer needed as we have added USB Client support right into the [USB](../../interface/usb) Interface. Any DUELink module can do this now!!
