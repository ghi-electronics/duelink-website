# Codec

---

This is a high quality audio codec, capable of playing MP3 and other audio formats. It even has recording capabilities.

Data is transferred in very small chunks, adding a lot of stress on the data streams on the DUELink bus. It worked fine at lower bitrates but we were not fully satisfied. We are still investigating options. Consider using [MP3 PLayer](../sound/mp3) module for now.
