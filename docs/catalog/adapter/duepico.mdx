DuePico is the perfect adapter for RPI (Raspberry Pi) Pico. It gracefully takes the RPI Pico on its back side and offers all RPI Pico connections on female headers, allowing to connect it as you wish. 

![DuePico with Raspberry Pi Pico](pathname:///img/duepico-pico.png)

On the front side, the board includes several peripherals, including buttons, buzzer, and a graphical display. The display is controlled using the DUELink native [Graphics](../../engine/graphics) support. Simple commands are used to control the display instead of replying on RPI Pico.

The onboard 800mA regulator is used to feed power to the Downlink connector, keeping any loads away from the RPI Pico's 3.3V source.

The USB connector is conveniently there to help with loading/updating the DUELink processor's firmware/drivers. It should not be used when DuePico is used with a RPI Pico.

:::note
With the USB connector and the onboard power regulator, this adapter can be used as a Microcomputer with full functionality without the need of any RPI!
