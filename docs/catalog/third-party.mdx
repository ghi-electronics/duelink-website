# Third-party Modules

---

DUELink is designed with one important goal in mind, to work with all other ecosystems and allow users to make their own modules! 

**"DUELink doesn't have competitors, it has friends!"** - Gus Issa, CEO. 

We are giving you everything you need to make your own DUELink modules. We only ask you not to use GHI Electronics and DUELink logos without written permission from us, see [Legal Licensing](../legal) for details. Beside that, we have got you covered, from hardware to software!

## Hardware

The micro we use on DUELink is STM32C071. You can integrate this micro on your modules and you are halfway to having your own DUELink modules!

If you are not comfortable using a very tiny QFN32 chip, we have made [Stick](../products/mcstick-a), which brings all the connections to 0.1” headers and castellated holes. It also includes both U and D connectors.

The [Sticker](../products/adsticker-c), is the development board for the [Stick](../products/mcstick-a), which brings all its available connections to pin headers for easy prototyping and testing.

We also offer [Stamp](../products/mcstamp-b), an ultra-small board with USB C connector on-board.

## Software

![Logo](pathname:///img/duelinklogo.webp)

There isn't much you need to do on the software front, maybe only a simple [Driver](../engine/drivers). You are welcome to [Download](../downloads) and use the DUELink firmware hex files on your own creations, free of charge, for commercial and non-commercial use!
