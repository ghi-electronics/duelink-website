# MakeCode


![MakeCode](pathname:///img/makecode.png)

For users who enjoy block-coding, Microsoft MakeCode allows users to easily build programs without the need to write code! This is mostly used on [micro:bit](../hw/microbit), which is supported by DUELink.

![LinkBit](pathname:///img/microbit-linkbit.png)


Microsoft MakeCode **Arcade** is variant of MakeCode that has an Arcade game engine. [BrainPad Arcade](../hw/arcade) includes [Downlink](../interface/downlink) connector for a qn easy game-development with physical-computing.

## Connections

See [micro:bit](../hw/microbit) pages for connection options. However, [BrainPad Arcade](../hw/arcade) just plug in!

---

## Blinky

Create a project on [makecode.microbit.org](https://makecode.microbit.org/) or [arcade.makecode.com/](https://arcade.makecode.com/), depending on which hardware you have.

This example blinks the status LED 50 times on any Downlink module. The command sent is `statled(200,200,50)`, as documented on the [Standard Library](../engine/stdlib) page.

```js
function ExecuteCommand (str: string) {
  pins.i2cWriteBuffer(0x52, Buffer.fromUTF8(str), false);
  let buf = pins.createBuffer(1)
  buf[0] = 10
  pins.i2cWriteBuffer(0x52, buf)
}
ExecuteCommand("statled(200,200,50)");
```

In blocks, the code above looks like this:

The LED will blink 50 times then stops!

## Extension

A DUELink extension is planned for the future. Consider the other supported alternatives below.

## Alternatives

![MicroBlocks](pathname:///img/microblocks.png)

If using [miro:bit](../hw/microbit), conceder using [MicroBlocks](./microblocks) as another great block-coding option. It is fully supported by DUELink.
