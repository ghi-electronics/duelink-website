# MakeCode


![MakeCode](pathname:///img/makecode.png)

For users who enjoy block-coding, Microsoft MakeCode allows users to easily build programs without the need to write code! This is mostly used on [micro:bit](../hw/microbit), which is supported by DUELink.

Microsoft MakeCode **Arcade** is variant of MakeCode that has an Arcade game engine. [BrainPad Arcade](../hw/arcade) includes [Downlink](../interface/downlink) connector for a qn easy game-development with physical-computing.

## Connections

See [micro:bit](../hw/microbit) pages for connection options. However, [BrainPad Arcade](../hw/arcade) just plug in!

## Blinky

Create a project on [makecode.microbit.org](https://makecode.microbit.org/) or [arcade.makecode.com/](https://arcade.makecode.com/), depending on which hardware you have.

Click on "Extensions".

(image)

Cope/paste this link https://github.com/ghi-electronics/duelink_makecode into the top bar and click enter. Then select the DUELink extension.

(image)

You now have DUELink added to the project.

(image)

You can now use `Set Stat LED` block to control the status LED on the first connected DUELink module.

(image)

If you have more than one module then use `Select device` block to select the desired module. We can for example blink the LED slow on the first device but blink fast on the second device.

The `Execute Command` is powerful block. It gives you access to any internal commands, no mater if they come from [standard library](../engine/stdlib) or are from [drivers](../engine/drivers). An example can be in using it to control the status LED, like we just did before, but this time using the function directly `statled(100,100,10)`.

:::tip
All blocks use `Execute Command` internally. They are provided for your convenience.

## Alternatives

![MicroBlocks](pathname:///img/microblocks.png)

[miro:bit](../hw/microbit) users can conceder [MicroBlocks](./microblocks) as another great block-coding option. It is fully supported by DUELink.
