# MakeCode

For users who enjoy block-coding, Microsoft MakeCode allows users to easily build programs without the need to write code! This is mostly used on [micro:bit](../hw/microbit), which is supported by DUELink.

Microsoft MakeCode **Arcade** is variant of MakeCode that has an Arcade game engine. [BrainPad Arcade](../hw/arcade) includes [Downlink](../interface/downlink) connector adding physical-computing to game-development.

## Connections

[BrainPad Arcade](../hw/arcade) with it's `Downlink` connector just plugs in! See [micro:bit](../hw/microbit) pages for connection options.

## Blinky

Create a project on [makecode.microbit.org](https://makecode.microbit.org/) or [arcade.makecode.com](https://arcade.makecode.com/), depending on which hardware you have.

![Create Project](pathname:///img/makecode-project.png)

Click on `Extensions`.

![Add Extension](pathname:///img/makecode-extension.png)

Copy/paste this link into the top bar and click enter. Then select the DUELink extension.
```py
https://github.com/ghi-electronics/duelink_makecode
```

![Search Extension](pathname:///img/makecode-search.png)

DUELink extension is now added to the project.

You can now use `Set Stat LED` block to control the status LED on the first connected DUELink module.

If you have more than one module then use `Select device` block to select the desired module. You can for example blink the LED slow on the first device, but blink it fast on the second device.

The `Execute Command` block is a powerful one! It gives you access to any internal commands, no matter if they come from [standard library](../engine/stdlib) or from [drivers](../engine/drivers). A good example is using it to control the status LED, like we just did before, but this time using the `statled(100,100,10)` function directly.

:::tip
All blocks use `Execute Command` internally, but provided for your convenience.

## Alternatives

![MicroBlocks](pathname:///img/microblocks.png)

[micro:bit](../hw/microbit) users may also consider [MicroBlocks](./microblocks) as another great block-coding option. It is fully supported by DUELink.
