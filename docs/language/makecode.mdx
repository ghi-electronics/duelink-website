For users who enjoy block-coding, MakeCode allows [micro:bit](../hw/microbit) users to utilize hundreds of DUELink modules. While MakeCode supports many boards, we will focus on [micro:bit](../hw/microbit).

## Connections

To connect micro:bit to one of the many DUElink modules, you can use the [LinkBit](../catalog/adapter/linkbit) module. It extends the micro:bit edge connector and adds a [Downlink](../interface/downlink) connector.

Alternately you can also use any of the boards that include an on-board JST connector like the [Sparkfun Qwiic micro:bit Breakout](https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-qwiic-micro-bit-breakout.html)

This board includes two JST sockets. One of them becomes a [Downlink](../interface/downlink) bringing you hundreds of DUELink module options, that connect in a [Daisylink](../engine/daisylink).

Most of these boards don't have the required pull-up resistors on the I2C bus. This might not be a problem in most cases, but we have a [PullUp](../catalog/adapter/pullup) module to solve this if there's an issue. When using our [LinkBit](../catalog/adapter/linkbit) adapter a PullUp module isn't needed.

## Blinky

Create a MakeCode project like you always did on [makecode.microbit.org](https://makecode.microbit.org/).

![micro:bit MakeCode](pathname:///img/microbit-makecode.png)

This example blinks the status LED 50 times on any Downlink module

```js
function SendCommand(str: string) {
  pins.i2cWriteBuffer(0x1a, Buffer.fromUTF8(str), false);
}
SendCommand("statled(200,200,50)");
```

In blocks, the code above looks like this:

![MakeCode Send Commands](pathname:///img/makecode-blocks.png)

The LED will blink 50 times then stops!

## Extension

A DUELink extension is planned for the future. Consider the other supported alternatives below.

## Alternatives

![MicroBlocks](pathname:///img/microblocks.png)

Another great block-coding option is [MicroBlocks](./microblocks). It is fully supported, allowing micro:bit to connect to DULink modules.

[Arduino](../hw/arduino) is another great option if your board supports it.
