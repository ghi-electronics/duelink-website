For users who enjoy block-coding, Microsoft MakeCode allows users to easily build programs without the need to write code! This is mostly used on [micro:bit](../hw/microbit), which is supported by the DUELink ecosystem.

Microsoft MakeCode **Arcade** is variant of MakeCode that has an Arcade game engine. [BrainPad Arcade](../hw/arcade) includes [Downlink](../interface/downlink) connector adding physical-computing to game-development.

:::tip
MakeCode does not run on DUELink modules directly but you can use third party modules that support to MakeCode to tether to the DUELink ecosystem.

[MicroBlocks](./microblocks) is a block-coding alternative that is fully supported.

## Connections

[BrainPad Arcade](../hw/arcade) with it's `Downlink` connector just plugs in! See [micro:bit](../hw/microbit) pages for connection options.

## Blinky

Create a project on [makecode.microbit.org](https://makecode.microbit.org/) or [arcade.makecode.com](https://arcade.makecode.com/), depending on which hardware you have.

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}>
![Create Project](pathname:///img/makecode-project.webp)
</div>

Click on `Extensions`.

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}>
![Add Extension](pathname:///img/makecode-extension.webp)
</div>

Copy/paste this link into the top bar and click enter. Then select the DUELink extension.
```py
https://github.com/ghi-electronics/duelink_makecode
```

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}>
![Search Extension](pathname:///img/makecode-search.webp)
</div>

DUELink extension is now added to the project.

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}>
![Add Extension](pathname:///img/makecode-duelink.webp)
</div>

You can now use `Set Stat LED` block to control the status LED on the first connected DUELink module.

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}>
![Blink StatLED Block](pathname:///img/makecode-statled-block.webp)
</div>

If you have more than one module then use `Select device` block to select the desired module. You can for example blink the LED slow on the first device, but blink it fast on the second device.

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}>
![Select Device Block](pathname:///img/makecode-select-device.webp)
</div>

The `Execute Command` block is a powerful one! It gives you access to any internal commands, no matter if they come from [standard library](../engine/stdlib) or from [drivers](../engine/drivers). A good example is in using `Execute Command` to control the status LED, like we just did before, but this time using the `statled(100,100,10)` function directly.

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}>
![Execute Command Block](pathname:///img/makecode-execute.webp)
</div>

:::tip
All blocks use `Execute Command` internally, but are provided for your convenience.

## Alternatives

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}>
![MicroBlocks](pathname:///img/microblocks.webp)
</div>

[micro:bit](../hw/microbit) users may also consider [MicroBlocks](./microblocks) as another great block-coding option. It is fully supported by DUELink.
