Swift can be used to give MacOS access to the physical world.

The support for SWIFT is incomplete. It is only provided as a reference for those interested in exploring the possibilities.

An example is found on the [DUELink Libraries](https://github.com/ghi-electronics/duelink-libraries/tree/main/macos) Repo.
