Any system with [USB](../interface/usb), [I2C](../interface/i2c), or [UART Serial](../interface/uart) can have access to physical computing, thanks to DUELink.

Take a serial port for example, if [Microsoft Excel](excel) can work with DUELink, anything else can!!

There are plenty of code libraries to help you understand and port to whatever you like! See [DUELink Libraries](https://github.com/ghi-electronics/duelink-libraries) repo.
