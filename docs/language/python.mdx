# Python

Python is the main language used with AI and data science. The provided DUELink Python library allows a full standard Python program to access the physical world. For example, an AI vision facial recognition can now control a door lock.

:::tip
Note that Python will be executed on one of the [supported hardware](../hw/intro) options, which is tethered to DUELink modules. Python does not run on the module itself!

## Setup

This page assumes the user is already familiar with Python and there is a development machine that is already setup to build and run Python programs.


:::tip
Make sure your hardware is updated with the latest firmware. The [Console](../console) can help with that!
:::

Start a new project with a simple line of code to test that the project is running.

```py
Print("Hello DUELink!")
```
---

## Libraries

We now need to install the DUELink Python library using `pip install DUELink`. You may also upgrade the libraries using `pip install --upgrade DUELink`. The DUELink package will also install all required dependencies.

:::tip
The DUELink python library requires pySerial, which may require an admin access to install.

## Blinky!

Our first program will blink the on-board status LED on a tethered module, on for 200ms then it shuts off for 800ms, and does this 20 times.

```py
from DUELink.DUELinkController import DUELinkController
print("Hello DUELink!")
availablePort = DUELinkController.GetConnectionPort()
print("Using port: ", availablePort)
duelink = DUELinkController(availablePort)
# Flash the LED  (on for 200ms, off for 800ms, 20 times)
duelink.System.StatLed(200,800,20)
print("Bye DUELink!")
```

:::tip
The Python library is open source: [DUELink Libraries Repo](https://github.com/ghi-electronics/duelink-libraries).

## Daisylinking

In the example below, we'll use Python to control an OLED 0.96 Display, a Button, and a Buzzer module Daisylinked together.

![Daisylinked Modules](pathname:///img/usbhook-daisylinked.webp)

:::tip
Make sure these modules are pre-loaded with [Drivers](../engine/drivers).
:::

```python
import time
from DUELink.DUELinkController import DUELinkController

availablePort = DUELinkController.GetConnectionPort()
duelink = DUELinkController(availablePort)

# Device 1 is Display OLDE 0.96, with driver installed! 
# Device 2 is button
# Device 3 is buzzer
duelink.ReadTimeout = 0.1  # 100 milliseconds

duelink.Engine.Select(1)
duelink.Graphics.Clear(1)
duelink.Graphics.Text("DUELink", 0, 10, 10)
duelink.Graphics.Text("Press button on", 0, 1, 21)
duelink.Graphics.Text("device 2 to play", 0, 1, 31)
duelink.Graphics.Text("sound on device 3", 0, 1, 41)
duelink.Graphics.Show()

duelink.Engine.Select(2)
duelink.Button.Enable(1, 0)

while True:
    duelink.Engine.Select(2)
    if duelink.Button.Down(1):
        duelink.Engine.Select(3)
        duelink.Frequency.Write(7, 1000, 50, 0.5)
    time.sleep(0.1)  # Sleep 100 milliseconds 

```

The earlier samples were generic and run on any module. The individual module's product pages. include specific samples.
