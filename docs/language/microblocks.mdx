# MicroBlocks


![MicroBlocks](pathname:///img/microblocks.png)

MicroBlocks is a blocks-language that makes it easy for beginners (9 years to adults) to program DUELink boards. A huge benefit of MicroBlocks is that it is live and
interactive: users can click commands to see what they do and they can test their scripts as they work.

Yet in spite of its apparent simplicity, MicroBlocks is a powerful programming language with the ability to interface with peripherals via GPIO, I2C, SPI, and serial;
and nearly 200 extension libraries. In fact, some hardware designers prefer MicroBlocks for rapid prototyping and testing because of its fast, interactive development cycle.

There are two ways beginners and educators can use MicroBlocks with DUELink:
1. Run **MicroBlocks on DUELink** modules/boards.
2. Use modules to start **Daisylinking with MicroBlocks**.

## MicroBlocks on DUELink

While you can load MicroBlocks on any DUELink module, some are recommended on the [educators](../educators) page.


### Installing the Firmware

To work with MicroBlocks, one must first install the MicroBlocks firmware,
a process that takes less than a minute.

Start by connecting your DUELink board to a laptop using a USB cable.
**Make sure it is not a charge-only cable!**

Prepare your board to accept firmware by holding down the **A** button (CincoBit or PixoBit), the left button (DueSTEM) or the **LDR** button (ClipIt) while pressing and releasing the small **Reset** or **RST** button:

<table>
<td width='50%'>
![CincoBit Reset](pathname:///img/cincobit-reset.png)
</td>
<td width='50%'>
![pixoBit Reset](pathname:///img/pixobit-reset.png)
</td>
</table>


<table>
<td width='50%'>
![duestem Reset](pathname:///img/duestem-reset.png)
</td>
<td width='50%'>
![clipIt Reset](pathname:///img/clipit-reset.png)
</td>
</table>

Open [console.duelink.com](https://console.duelink.com/) in a Chrome or Edge browser:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
![dueconsole](pathname:///img/duelink-console.png)
</div>

Click on the **Firmware** tab:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
![firmware](pathname:///img/console-firmware.png)
</div>

In the dialog that appears, click the **Connect** button:

![console](pathname:///img/console-connect-1.png)

If your board is connected and ready to accept firmware, you will see an entry marked **DFU in FS Mode**:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
![console](pathname:///img/console-connect-2.png)
</div>

If you see an entry marked **DUELink**, repeat the board preparation process described above. Remember to keep the **A** or **LDR** button held down while you press and release the **Reset** button.

If you do not see any entry, check that your board is connected to your laptop with a good USB cable.

Select the **DFU in FS Mode** entry and click the **Connect** button.

In the next dialog, select **MicroBlocks (microblocks.fun)** in the Firmware menu.

The version menu will default to the most recent version, which is what you want:

![console](pathname:///img/console-connect-3.png)

You'll see progress as the board is erased and then the firmware is written:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
![progress-erasing](pathname:///img/progress-erasing.png)
![progress-writing](pathname:///img/progress-writing.png)
</div>

Congratulations! You've installed MicroBlocks!

You don't need to install MicroBlocks firmware every time you use MicroBlocks, only if you want to update to a newer version or switch between MicroBlocks and the DUELink firmware.

:::note
Although this section has focused on installing MicroBlocks on educational DUELink boards, MicroBlocks can be installed on any DUELink board. For example, one might install MicroBlocks on the Holiday Tree and write a MicroBlocks program to control the lights.
:::

Once the MicroBlocks firmware is installed, you're ready to start coding!

### Connecting the Board

You can run MicroBlocks in a Chrome or Edge browser by visiting [microblocks.fun](https://microblocks.fun) and clicking the **Run** button in the top bar menu or by clicking [this link](https://microblocks.fun/run). You can also download a stand-alone app for Windows, MacOS, or Linux from the [Download page](https://microblocks.fun/download) on the website.

![Download](pathname:///img/microblocks-download.png)

The first step is to connect to the board.

Click the **Connect** button in the MicroBlocks editor:

![microblocks-connect](pathname:///img/microblocks-connect-1.png)

Select **Connect (USB)** from the menu:

![microblocks-connect](pathname:///img/microblocks-connect-2.png)

Select the DUELink board in the dialog that appears, then click the **Connect** button:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
![microblocks-connect](pathname:///img/microblocks-connect-3.png)
</div>

If you do not see your DUELink board, make sure it is connected with a good USB cable, then click its reset button.

When the board is connected, the **Connect** button turns green and the name of the board is displayed next to it:

![microblocks-connect](pathname:///img/microblocks-connect-4.png)

To verify that everything is working, click on the **set user LED** block in the **Output** category:

![microblocks-setuserled](pathname:///img/microblocks-setuserled.png)

On most DUELink boards, this will turn on the green **STAT** LED. On the CincoBit, which does not have a **STAT** LED, it will turn on the middle LED in the 5x5 LED display.

### Coding in MicroBlocks

MicroBlocks is a **live** coding environment so you can test as you code.
Click on blocks and scripts to run them.

Drag blocks into the scripting pane and assemble them to create scripts.

Your code is stored in persistent flash memory and can run even when the board is not connected to the MicroBlocks editor.

Scripts under a **when started** block run when the board is powered on.

MicroBlocks supports concurrency. Up to ten scripts can run at the same time.

### Examples

Here is a simple script for the CincoBit:

![demo cinco](pathname:///img/mb-demo-cinco.png)

Here is a similar script using the ClipIt's **A** touch pad:

![demo clipit](pathname:///img/mb-demo-clipit.png)

This script displays the light level as a bar graph on the PixoBit and DueSTEM. It also shows the temperature on the DueSTEM:

![demo duestem](pathname:///img/mb-demo-duestem.png)


In addition to its many built-in blocks, MicroBlocks has nearly 200 libraries that support additional features and peripherals.
Click the **Add Library** button to add libraries.

Assuming you using a [CincoBit](../products/mccincobit-e), we will show a smiley face on the LEDs. Click on the `Add Library` button and Open the `LED Display`. This will add the 5x5 LED Matrix block.

![Connect](pathname:///img/microblocks-library.png)

Click on the block itself and it will activate the LEDs on CincoBit. Any changes we make are instantly transferred to the device.

![Smile and Frown](pathname:///img/microblocks-instant.gif)

This program will switch from a "smile" to a "frown" based the pressed button.

## Daisylinking with MicroBlocks

MicroBlocks can control one or more external DUELink modules connected via [Daisylink](../engine/daisylink). When you do this, only the first module in the chain runs the MicroBlocks firmware. All other modules in the chain run the standard DUELink firmware and respond to commands from MicroBlocks.

![PixoBit Daisylinked](pathname:///img/pixobit-daisylinked.png)


### Daisylink Connections

If you are running MicroBlocks on a DUELink educational board (or other DUELink module),
connect the Downlink (**D**) connector on that board:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
![Cincobit downlink port](pathname:///img/cincobit-downlink.png)
</div>

to the Uplink (**U**) connector of the DUELink module:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
![RGB3 uplink port](pathname:///img/rgb3-uplink.png)
</div>

If you are running MicroBlocks on a non-DUELink board,
connect the Daisylink module chain to your board's I2C pins.
If you have a micro:bit, you can use a
[LinkBit](../products/adlinkbit-a)
to connect to the I2C pins:

![Linkbit](pathname:///img/microbit-linkbit.png)

When using multiple DUELink modules, modules are daisy-chained together by connecting
the Downlink (**D**) connector of one module to the Uplink (**U**) connector of the next
(see [Daisylink](../engine/daisylink)):

:::tip
Once all connections have been made, power cycle the entire chain to reset
all modules before attempting to use any module.
:::

![Uplink/Downlink Connections](pathname:///img/mb-uplink-downlink.png)

:::tip
Always connect a Downlink (**D**) connector to an Uplink (**U**) connector.
Nothing will work if a **D** is connected to a **D** or a **U** to a **U** anywhere in the chain.
:::


### MicroBlocks Libraries

We maintain a set of MicroBlocks libraries to support its growing collection of DUELink modules. You'll use those of libraries to control your DUELink modules from MicroBlocks.

Download the MicroBlocks libraries from the **MicroBlocks Firmware/Lib** section on the [Downloads Page](../downloads). Be sure to select the "Libraries" tab and download the latest available version:

![lib download](pathname:///img/mb-lib-download.png)

Unzip the downloaded file and place the folder of libraries in a convenient location.

In the MicroBlocks editor, click the **Add Library** button:

![add-library](pathname:///img/add-library.png)

then select the **Computer** shortcut:

![computer-shortcut](pathname:///img/computer-shortcut.png)

Navigate to the folder of libraries you saved and add the libraries for the features you want to use. You will also need the DUELink library.

### Daisylink Example

Connect an RGB3 module to the **D** port of your board. Power cycle the board and module by disconnecting and then reconnecting the USB cable.

Open the MicroBlocks editor, connect to your board, then load the **DUELink** and **DUELink.Digital** libraries:

![duelink-and-digital-libraries](pathname:///img/duelink-and-digital-libraries.png)

Click the **DUELink connected?** block in the DUELink library palette to verify that your DUELink module is connected and detected by MicroBlocks:

![connected-test](pathname:///img/connected-test.png)

The LEDs on the RGB3 module are controlled by pins 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 11.

Use the **Write pin** block from the DUELink.Digital library to turn on LED 1 (a blue one):

![turn-on-blue-led](pathname:///img/turn-on-blue-led.png)

This script will flash all of the LEDs on the RGB3 module in sequence when the A button is pressed:

![blink-rgb-leds](pathname:///img/blink-rgb-leds.png)

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
![animated GIF of flashing LEDs](pathname:///img/microblocks-daisylinked.gif)
</div>

## MicroBlocks Everywhere!

We recommend loading MicroBlocks on boards recommended for [educators](../educators). From there, all other modules can be daisylinked as shown earlier. However, it is still possible to load MicroBlocks on any DUELink module! For example, load MicroBlocks on the [LED RGB3](../products/ldledrgb3-a) to control the LEDs directly from blocks.

Since [LED RGB3](../products/ldledrgb3-a) does not have a USB connector, it will need an adapter such as [USB Hook](../products/adusbhook-a).

![USB Hook for LED RGB3](pathname:///img/usbhook-rgb3.png)

When MicroBlocks firmware is installed it replaces the DUELink standard firmware, so controlling the module's hardware must be done with MicroBlocks code. For modules with simple hardware such as LED's, buttons, and analog sensors, the MicroBlocks code is easy to write. However, more complex modules such as displays and SD card readers are best used as Daisylinked modules so one can take advantage of the hardware support built into the DUELink standard firmware. For example, MicroBlocks firmware can be loaded on [CincoBit](../products/mccincobit-e), which then connected the [SD Card](../products/stsdcard-b) module that is running the DUELink standard firmware.
