# MicroPython


![MicroPython](pathname:///img/micropython.webp)

You can use DUELink with any microcontroller that supports MicroPython, include Raspberry Pi RP2040 and RP2350. Boards that have JST connector can plug in directly. However, you can use the [Breakout](../products/adbreakout-a) module to to connect any board! The [interface](../interface/intro) can be [I2C](../interface/i2c) or [UART](../interface/uart).

For MicroPython with DUELink is also fully supported on [Raspberry Pi](../hw/raspberry-pi) microcontroller-level (RP2040/RP2350) boards, such as Raspberry Pi Pico.

We also offer [DuePico](../products/adduepico-b), the perfect Raspberry Pi Pico adapter!

As for IDE options, you can use whatever you prefer. In the following examples, we'll use [Thonny](https://thonny.org/) IDE to program the RaspberryPi that is plugged into a [DuePico's](../products/adduepico-b).

## Setup

First make sure your board is set up for MicroPython. Follow the steps found at [MicroPython.org](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/micropython.html) to load the firmware for your specific hardware.

Connect to the board by going to `Tools/Options` and select the proper `Interpreter`. In this case we'll be selecting `MicroPython(Raspberry Pi Pico)`.

![Thonny Connect](pathname:///img/thonny-connect.webp)

 We can test that everything is working correctly by blinking the Raspberry Pi Pico's onboard LED.

```python
import machine
import time

led = machine.Pin(25, machine.Pin.OUT)

while True:
    led.on()  
    time.sleep(1) 
    led.off() 
    time.sleep(1)  
```

## Libraries

Users have two options for loading the DUELink MicroPython library into Thonny. They can either download the [duelink-stdlib-mp](https://pypi.org/project/duelink-stdlib-mp/#files) file found at `pypi.org` to their computer, and `Install from local file` found under `Tools/Manage packages`. 

![DUELink library from local file](pathname:///img/download-mp-library.webp)

Alternatively, users can type `duelink-stdlib-mp` into the search window and `Install from PyPi` directly.

## Blinky!

We can now access the complete DUELink [standard library](../engine/stdlib) from inside Thonny. We need to use [UART Interface](../interface/uart) to communicate to the modules when using Raspberry Pi Pico. Let's blink the `STAT` led on a connected DUELink module. 

```py
import time
import machine
import duelink
 
from duelink import transport
 
uart = transport.UartTransportController(0)
due = duelink.DUELinkController(uart)

due.system.statled(50,50,0)
```

You can also use boards that already have a JST connector, like [Adafruit QT Py RP2040](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4900) or [Sparkfun Pro Micro RP2350](https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-pro-micro-rp2350.html). However, note that these boards use the [I2C Interface](../interface/i2c).

![Other boards](pathname:///img/rp2040-rp2350.webp)

```python
import time
import machine
import duelink
 
from duelink import transport
from machine import Pin, Timer
 
sclPIN = machine.Pin(23)
sdaPIN = machine.Pin(22)
 
i2c = transport.I2CTransportController(sda=sdaPIN, scl=sclPIN)
due = duelink.DUELinkController(i2c)
 
due.system.statled(50,50,0)
```

:::tip
Some third-party boards are not properly equipped with the proper I2C pull up resistors. The DUEink pull-up board can be used to solve this problem. See [I2C Interface](../interface/i2c) page for more details.

## Daisylinking

In the example below, we'll use the DuePico connected to an OLED 0.96 Display, Button, and Buzzer modules. 

:::tip
Make sure these modules are loaded with [Drivers](../engine/drivers).
:::

Note how the DuePico itself is a module, which is `Device 1`.

![DuePico Daisylinked](pathname:///img/duepico-daisylinked.webp)


```python
import time
import duelink  # standard lib

from duelink import transport

# device 1 is DuePico
# device 2 is OLED 96
# device 3 is Button S
# device 4 is Buzzer

uart = transport.UartTransportController(0)
due = duelink.DUELinkController(uart)

due.Engine.Select(1)#DuePico Display
due.Graphics.Clear(0)
due.Graphics.TextS("DUELink", 1, 30, 27,2,2)
due.Graphics.Show()

due.Engine.Select(2)#OLED 96 Module
due.Graphics.Clear(0)
due.Graphics.Text("--DUELink--", 1, 30, 1)
due.Graphics.Text("Press button on", 1, 1, 21)
due.Graphics.Text("device 2 to play", 1, 1, 31)
due.Graphics.Text("sound on device 3", 1, 1, 41)
due.Graphics.Show()

due.Engine.Select(3)#Button Module
due.Button.Enable(1,1,1)
due.Engine.Select(1)#DuePico `A` Button
due.Button.Enable(20,1,2)

while True:
    due.Engine.Select(3)#Button Module    
    if due.Button.Down(1):
        due.Engine.Select(4)
        due.Frequency.Write(7, 1000, 100, 0.5)
 
    time.sleep(0.1)
    
    due.Engine.Select(1)#DuePico Module 
    if due.Button.Down(20):
        due.Frequency.Write(11, 1000, 100, 0.5)
 
    time.sleep(0.1)
```

:::tip
With DUELink we can control multiple modules of the same type. For example, we can show information on both displays.

The earlier samples were generic and run on any module. The individual module's product pages. include specific samples.
