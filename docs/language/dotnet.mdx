# .NET


![.NET C#](pathname:///img/csharp.webp)

The .NET DUELink library allows full .NET programs to access physical sensors and actuators. This allows complex .NET programs to do all the heavy lifting.

Note that the provided library is implemented in C#, but the user can use any .NET system, such as Visual Basic.

## Setup

This page assumes the user is already familiar with .NET C# and there is a development machine that is already setup to build and run .NET programs.

:::tip
Make sure your hardware is updated with the latest firmware. The [Console](../console) is handy for that.
:::

Start a new project with a simple line of code to test that the project is running.

:::info
C# Top-level-statements feature is being utilized in these examples.
:::

```cs
Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
```
---

## Libraries

Download and install the latest `GHIElectronics.DUELink` library from NuGet.org.

## Blinky!

Our first program will blink the on-board status LED, on for 200ms then it shuts off for 800ms, and does this 20 times.

```cs
using GHIElectronics.DUELink;
Console.WriteLine("Hello DUE!");
var availablePort = DUELinkController.GetConnectionPort();
var duelink = new DUELinkController(availablePort);

// Flash the LED  (on for 200ms, off for 800ms, 20 times)
// Note that "Device 1" is automatically selected
duelink.System.Statled(200, 800, 20);
Console.WriteLine("Bye DUE!");
```

:::tip
The .NET library is open source: [DUELink Libraries Repo](https://github.com/ghi-electronics/duelink-libraries).

## Daisylinking

In the example below, we'll use .NET to control an OLED 0.96 Display, a Button, and a Buzzer module Daisylinked together.

![Daisylinked Modules](pathname:///img/usbhook-daisylinked.webp)

:::tip
Make sure these modules are loaded with [Drivers](../engine/drivers).
:::

```cs
using GHIElectronics.DUELink;

var availablePort = DUELinkController.GetConnectionPort();
var duelink = new DUELinkController(availablePort);

static void BasicExample() {
     // Device 1 is Display OLDE 0.96, with driver installed! 
     // Device 2 is button
     // device 3 is buzzer
     duelink.ReadTimeout = TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(100);
     duelink.Engine.Select(1);
     duelink.Graphics.Clear(1);
     duelink.Graphics.Text("DUELink", 0, 10, 10);
     duelink.Graphics.Text("Press button on", 0, 1, 21);
     duelink.Graphics.Text("device 2 to play", 0, 1, 31);
     duelink.Graphics.Text("sound on device 3", 0, 1, 41);   
     duelink.Graphics.Show();
 
     duelink.Engine.Select(2);
     duelink.Button.Enable(1, true, 1);
 
     while (true) {
         duelink.Engine.Select(2);
         if (duelink.Button.Down(1)) {
             duelink.Engine.Select(3);
             duelink.Frequency.Write(7, 1000, 50, 0.5);
         }
         Thread.Sleep(100);
     }
}
