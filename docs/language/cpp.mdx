# C++/Arduino

There are two ways to use C++ with DUELink, hosted or Standalone.

---

## Hosted

With a hosted option, a [PC & Laptop](../hw/pc-laptop) or [Phone & Tablets](../hw/phone-tablet.mdx) can be used to run the C++ program to command DUELink modules through [USB](../interface/usb) or [UART Serial](../interface/uart) interfaces.

We do nto provide a library for C++ as most of DUELink users enjoy the high-level supported languages, such as [.NET C#](./dotnet) and [Python](./python).

Note that the [Arduino](../hw/arduino) library is C++ and will likely work with little changes. This is not an officially supported option however.

---

## Standalone

We recommend using [Arduino](../hw/arduino), which is C++ at its core but presents itself in a easier setup.

You can use any other C++ compiler with STM32C071 microcontroller support, including free [STM32CubeIDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html). We however internally use ARM Keil MDK. This is a paid professional IDE but [ST Micro offers a free licensed for any STM32 Cortex-M0 micro](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/kan344/latest/?lang=en).

:::tip
These options use low-end versatile libraries. They are powerful but not user friendly! [Arduino](../hw/arduino) is a user-friendly alternative.
:::

Any DFU update tool can be used to load your compiled program onto a DUELink module. We recommend the [STM32CubeProgrammer](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html).

:::tip
99.9% of modules include SWD pins for connecting debuggers, such as ST-Link. SWCLK is found on the through hole "boot pads" or LDR button. SWDIO is found on a tiny SMT pad. This is a non-supported feature.
