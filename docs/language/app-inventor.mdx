[MIT App Inventor](https://appinventor.mit.edu/) allows anyone, including children, to build mobile apps with ease.

There are 2 ways to access DUELink modules from App Inventor, either USB or Bluetooth.

Examples are provided to get you started, but this is an experimental support. Consider one of the fully supported options, such as [Python](./python).

## USB

This only works with Android as iOS does not support the standard USB CDC Class. As for the modules, you can either use one of the modules with built-in USB, such as the ultra-low-cost [CincoBit](../products/mccincobit-e) or add [USB Hook](../products/adusbhook-a).

## Wireless

Wireless is a bit easier as there is no physical connection to the phone or tablet. These devices can pair with [Wireless ESP32](../products/wlesp32-a), which in turn brings the chain of [DaisyLink](../engine/daisylink) devices to the [Wireless](../interface/wireless) connection via WiFi or Bluetooth.
