[MIT App Inventor](https://appinventor.mit.edu/) allows anyone, including children, to build mobile apps with ease.

There are 2 ways to access DUELink modules from App Inventor, either USB or Bluetooth.

Examples are provided to get you started, but this is an experimental support.

## USB

You can build apps that control actuators and read sensors, right from a tethered phone. Note that this only works on Android as iOS does not support the standard USB CDC Class. Modules with USB connectors, such as [DueSTEM](../products/mcduestem-b), can tether to a phone directly.

Other modules without USB connectors will need a adapter, such as [USB Hook](../products/adusbhook-a).

## Wireless

Wireless is a bit easier as there is no physical connection to the phone or the tablet. These devices can pair with [Wireless ESP32](../products/wlesp32-a), which in turn brings the chain of [DaisyLink](../engine/daisylink) devices to the [Wireless](../interface/wireless) connection via WiFi or Bluetooth.

## Demo

This is a demo sample to help you get started. It includes both USB and Bluetooth. Log in to App Inventor and then load [this file](https://github.com/ghi-electronics/duelink-libraries/tree/main/appinventor).
