# JavaScript


![JavaScript](pathname:///img/javascript.webp)

JavaScript is one of the core technologies used by the World Wide Web. 98% of all websites use JavaScript. Websites can now use the provided DUELink JavaScript library to access the physical world.

Here is a website demo to demonstrate how JavaScript can control actuators and read sensors: [demo.duelink.com](https://demo.duelink.com/). It is covered in the [Getting Started](../start) page.

:::tip
Note that JavaScript will be executed on one of the [supported hardware](../hw/intro) options, which is tethered to DUELink modules. JavaScript does not run on the module itself!

## Setup

This page assumes the user is already familiar with JavaScript and there is a development machine that is already setup to build and run JavaScript programs. We'll be running our program on a local machine using `Node.js`.

Install the `duelink` package:

```js
npm install duelink
```

If using serialport, `dlserialusb` package is needed:

```js
npm install dlserialusb
```

:::tip
Make sure your hardware is updated with the latest firmware. The [Console](../console) can help with that!
:::

Start a new project with a simple line of code to test that the project is running.

```js
console.log("Hello World");
```

## Blinky!

Our program will blink the on-board status LED on a tethered module, on for 200ms then it shuts off for 800ms, and does this 20 times. We will be using SerialUSB() here. If running on a website, use WebSerial() instead.

Note that using `await` is very critical because JavaScript is designed to run tasks asynchronously. DUELink is accesses hardware live, in real-time. Things must run in order and using `await` is required with anything DUElink!

```js
const { SerialUSB } = require("dlserialusb");
const { DUELinkController } = require("duelink");

async function Blinky() {
  let duelink = new DUELinkController(new SerialUSB());

  await duelink.Connect();

  // Flash the LED  (on for 200ms, off for 800ms, 20 times)
  await duelink.system.statled(200, 800, 20);
}

Blinky();
```

:::tip
The Python library is open source: [DUELink Libraries Repo](https://github.com/ghi-electronics/duelink-libraries).

## Daisylinking

In the example below, we'll use Python to control an OLED 0.96 Display, a Button, and a Buzzer module Daisylinked together.

![Daisylinked Modules](pathname:///img/usbhook-daisylinked.webp)

:::tip
Make sure these modules are loaded with [Drivers](../engine/drivers).
:::

```js
// code!
```

The earlier sample were generic and run on any module. The individual module's product pages. include specific samples.
