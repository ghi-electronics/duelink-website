# Standalone


DUELink is designed from the ground up to work with your favorite [hardware](../hw/intro) and your favorite [language](./intro). For example, you can use a phone to control a [daisylink](../engine/daisylink) of DUELink modules.

 We call the device controlling the other DUELink modules a "host". This host will be running one of the provided libraries, like [Python](./python) for example. Similar to a [phone](../hw/phone-tablet) or [PC](../hw/pc-laptop), you can use a [Raspberry Pi](../hw/raspberry-pi) or an [Arduino](../hw/arduino).

Additionally, DUELink modules are self-contained mini-computers that can also run standalone. In this case, the first module (button in this case) is the "Host", which is controlling the other [Daisylinked](../engine/daisylink) modules. The power modules (red ones) are just a power sources.

There are multiple options that you can use to turn any DUELink module into a "host", running **standalone**:

* Scripting
* MicroBlocks
* C++
* Arduino

## DUELink Scripting Engine

![DUELink Logo](pathname:///img/duelinklogo.webp)

This is the easiest option and most versatile. The default firmware already includes an [Internal Engine](../engine/intro) that has a [Scripting](../engine/scripting) language. It is easy to learn, making it a great choice for [educators](../educators), yet it is flexible enough to run complete applications for [Makers](../makers) and [Engineers](../engineers).

Visit the [Internal Engine](../engine/intro) and [Scripting](../engine/scripting) language pages for more details.

Modules can also become a `Host()` to other modules, as explained on the [Daisylink](../engine/daisylink) page.

## MicroBlocks

This is a block-based coding option, a great choice for educators, young learners, or anyone interested in coding but without "typing" the code!

Visit [MicroBlocks](./microblocks) language page to get started.

## C++

ST Micro offers STMCubeIDE as a complete solution to program STM micros. It is free and complete with many options.

Another option is [Keil MDK](https://www.keil.com/), which is what we use at GHI Electronics. This is a commercial-grade paid-software, but it is licensed to be used for free on STM32C071.

Visit the [C++](./cpp) page to learn more.

## Arduino

Arduino is basically C++ but with easier user-friendly libraries and a very large community.

The [Arduino](../hw/arduino) page shows how to use it with DUELink modules in 2 ways, one with using Arduino as a host and second by loading Arduino on a DUELink module.
