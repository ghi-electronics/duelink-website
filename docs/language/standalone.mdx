# Standalone

DUELink is designed from the ground up to tether with your favorite [hardware](../hw/intro), using your favorite [coding language](./intro). For example, you can use a phone to control a [Daisylink](../engine/daisylink) of DUELink modules.

Tethered modules are controlled by programs running on the "host", which will be codded with one of the provided software libraries, like [Python](./python) and [JavaScript](./javascript) for example. This "host" can but a powerful [PC](../hw/pc-laptop) or simple [Arduino](../hw/arduino) board.

Additionally, DUELink modules are self-contained mini-computers that can also run standalone. Not only that, any standalone DUELink module can be a tethered to other DUELink modules!

There are multiple options for running **standalone**:

* DUELink Scripts
* MicroBlocks
* Arduino
* C++

## DUELink Scripting Engine

</div>

DUELink firmware includes an [Internal Engine](../engine/intro) that has a [Scripting](../engine/scripting) language. It is easy to learn, making it a great choice for [educators](../educators), yet it is flexible enough to run complete applications for [Makers](../makers) and [Engineers](../engineers).

Visit the [Internal Engine](../engine/intro) and [Scripting](../engine/scripting) language pages for more details.

## MicroBlocks

</div>

This is a block-based coding option, a great choice for educators, young learners, or anyone interested in coding but without "typing" the code!

Visit [MicroBlocks](./microblocks) language page to get started.

## Arduino

Arduino is essentially C++ wrapped in a nice setup, with user-friendly libraries and a very large community.

The [Arduino](../hw/arduino) page shows how it can be used in 2 different ways: Tether Arduino compatible board to DUELink modules or load and run the Arduino software on any DUELink module!

## C++

ST Micro offers STMCubeIDE as a complete solution to program STM micros. It is free and complete with many options.

Another option is [Keil MDK](https://www.keil.com/), which is what we use at GHI Electronics. This is a paid-software. Fortunately, ST Micro has licensed it to be used for free on Cortex-M0 micros, such as the STM32C071 we use on DUELink modules.

Visit the [C++](./cpp) page to learn more.
