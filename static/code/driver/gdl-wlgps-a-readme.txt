1. Make sure the status LED is blinking.
2. Make sure the red led on GPS module is on (or blinking).
3. Wait until ‘Antenna OK’ appears in the log box output.

Note: 
- An antenna must be connected to the GPS module.
- When the red LED on the GPS module is blinking, it means a valid GPS signal has been detected. This process can take a few minutes, depending on the environment.
- Waiting for the red LED on the GPS module to start blinking is not part of the standard testing process, as it can take a long time. However, it is recommended to bring the test kit outdoors and perform this test at least once after programming every 10 modules.
